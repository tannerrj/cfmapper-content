Greetings Adventurer!  Here to test your skills and abilities?
@match skills|skill|test|abilities|portal|arch
@question reward A reward, really?
@question key Can you tell me anything about the red key?
Proceed through the archway ahead and bring back the red key and choose a reward..
@match reward
@question key Can you tell me anything about the red key?
Why yes, a reward.  To your left is a Potion of Healing - recover and heal yourself after battle, and a Potion of Minor Potion of LIfe - recover lost stats after an untimely, but momentary death. To your right is a Potion of Shielding - protect you for physical attacks for a limited time, and a Potion of Heroism - a tempary boost to your strength, health and quickness; great for combat during your many adventures.
@match key|red
@question reward So this key gives me a reward?
A sly and clever Gnoll Champion stole the key and I suspect he has it hidden somewhere in the dungeon.  Explore, use your might, use your wit.  Fight and survive and come back here to collect your prizes.
@match *
Good day, traveler!

A devious Ogre holds the key. But don't expect to find him to easily.  Explore, use your might, use your wit.  Fight and survive and come back here to collect your prize.

Water, earth, air and fire... It's a big task but the rewards are great! Enter the courthouse and you will understand me.  The major difficulty is finding the places that are involved in this quest.  E.g. I suspect the high volcano poses the fire-part...

The Pygmys are these evil little creatures that live in a forest on an island north and slightly east of this town...I had to use dimension door to get there...they are really dangerous and I'm sure they are guarding something in that forest...

I still have nightmares about my visit to the Pygmy Forest.

The headquarter of the Resistance can be found northwest of the Castle of Eureca.

If you want to become a priest of the Brave Goddess, but you can't pray, all you have to do is prove your faith by passing the test behind us, and She will gift you with a holy symbol blessed by Herself, which will allow you to pray at Her altar.  But beware, the test is not for beginners!
</pre></li>
<li>Priest of Valkyrie (6,4): <br /><pre>@match valkyrie
Valkyrie is the warrior goddess.  She abhors all magic, unnatural creatures and other similar abominations.  Therefore Her priests are forbidden to use magic, even priest magic.  Priests of other gods say we're not real priests if we don't have divine magic, but don't be fooled - She grants us with protection from filthy magic, and blesses our weapons if we're faithful enough.

Behold the glory of Valkyrie, the Deathbringer.

<ul><li>High Magistrate (42,25): <br /><pre>@match quest
Brave adventurer, you say? There are some troubling matters at hand. Would you risk your life on an urgent quest to save our fair city?
@match yes
Lying outside the city walls just under the cloud surface is a well hidden strike force of dragons aligned with the elf lord Valdak.  They have been lying in wait for months and our spies have only detected them last week! We have deduced that they are commanded by the Ancient dragon General Czarthin whom was previously lord Valdak's emissary to our city before he turned against us.  Many dragon agents have infiltrated our fair city and are believed to be under the direct command of Czarthin along with the strike force.  What is needed is the assassination of the Ancient dragon Czarthin... however a direct attack by one of our agents would bring complete destruction of our city by the strike force as well as the hundreds of mighty fire dragons stationed at the castle of lord Valdak.  We need you to silently slip into Czarthin's assembly and remove from him his life force... once done bring my Assistant a claw from his corpse.  For your reward you shall receive an esquire seal upon completion as-well as any treasure you loot from Czarthin's camp.

I am very happy that someone like you has finally come. What has happened is that the city is threatened from the east. The elf castle has grown great in power, the lord of that castle has suddenly turned against us. Another occurance that has cropped up is the increasing apperances of magical beings in the city... Dreads and beholders... some even in the fortifications of the city.
I cannot assault the castle myself... the elves with their dragon allies would burn this city to the ground... thus I need someone like you to sneak into the elven fortress. For his treason, I also want the head of the elf lord Valdak... and the head of his wife. To make sure there is no further uprising, slaughter everyone inside.
Your reward will be great.

Just drop a platinum coin on my desk and
you'll have three tries on the targets
behind me.
We have three different targets:
easy one : Zombie Target,
mediocre : Vampire Target,
hard one : Demilich Target.
The more DIFFERENT targets you get
with your 3 throws, the more prices
are at your choice.
Have a look at the exhibition to see
what you can win.
Don't forget to collect your winnings
BEFORE you have another go.
If you accidentally lost equipment
behind my targets I will try to
retrieve your stuff when you pay the
next coin. But I can't fetch weapons that stick
IN a target.

I am the Emissary of the Dragonlords to the City of Scorn.  I have come to present the Demands of my masters.  However, your King is less than cooperative.  I should tell my masters that the city is ripe for conquer.
@match demand
The Dragonlords demand in tribute:
10 virgins per year,
100 head of cattle,
and 100000 pieces of gold
Such tribute would help them express kindness by refraining from destroying your squalid little city.
@match dragonlord|master
My masters, the Dragonlords, are most puissant.  Few mortals may hope to overcome them in combat, for they wield such magics as would snuff the life of a mortal in seconds.  No mortal can deal blows, arcane or otherwise, quickly enough to destroy the Lords, before they themselves are destroyed.  The only way a mortal could destroy one of the Dragonlords is by some clever device, for none may face one in straight combat to the death and live.  To even challenge a Dragonlord to combat, you would have to pass all their draconic guards.  The last of these are Ancient Dragons, whose teeth are spears, whose claws are swords, and whose breath is death!  Would you know where the dragonlords dwell, so that you might behold their magnificence?

It's almost directly to the northeast of Scorn - about 400 chains.  Easiest way to get there is to take the north road outside of Scorn.  Once you get past the lake, start heading east/northeast - you will need to climb over some mountains.  If you run across a river, just start going north - keep going north past the like it flows from - about 75 chains.  The castle is in a valley with some hills and woods.

Plenty of monsters here.  Who'd have thought that the city government would put up with it?  But yet, this town has many havens for goblins and the like.  The giant's tower to the east, the uncouthly named 'newbie' tower just southwest of the lake.  The Mad Mage's tower to the south of the lake, and even some undead in the church and house near there.  That should do for a start.  If you desire a harder challenge, try the wizards over there.  They might have information.

@match yes|yup|aye
Well, maybe your greed will keep you alive, then.  I've known some people who have dragged their bones out of the grave for greed.  Smelly, and grumpy, every one!  Never underestimate the power of greed!  Well, I know of two places where you can get your hands on a powerful item.  One I know for sure:  a powerful magical Sword.  The other I'm not sure of, but it's inside a mountain, I bet.  Which do you want to hear about?
@match cave
I never explored his cave.  If you can get past his pets and into his Chamber, you'll probably find something interesting.  After the battle, the mountain was far too hot to be near, and I've had better things to do since then.  I don't think you'll be able to pass his vicious pets unless you're at least 15th Tier in your guild.  The mountain can be found north of the bend in the Great East Road.
@match mountain
I'll never forget that mountain.  I fought a battle atop it with a dark spirit.  His evil had begun to poison the land around his lair, so I challenged him to battle. When he issued forth from his cave to do battle with me, I rose up into the air above him, and blasted him with fire.  He somehow survived that first blast, so I threw yet a greater at him.  He survived that one too, so I stretched myself.  The next blast of fire scorched the mountain black (it remains so to this day).  Yet still he stood against me, so I thought he must somehow be immune.  Using the last of my strength, I blasted him with lightning.  He was destroyed, but I never looked into his cave.
@match sword
You've heard the rumors about the goings on in Navar, at the end of the Great East Road?
Well, Morkov, the former Wizard there, has turned to darkness.  He's out-and-out sold his soul.  Kill him and take his Sword.  He got it when he betrayed Navar and opened a gate for Evil to come through.  The flood of undead has taken over his Tower already.  The idiot city council there hasn't taken action yet.  Perhaps they're waiting for someone of the 13th or 14th Tier in their guilds to go kick Morkov out.

Yeah, that is what everyone does.  They walk in here, and just because I'm sitting all alone they think they can pump me for information.  Well, you're lucky, I'm actually in a talkative mood.  So, what type of adventure are you looking for?  An easy adventure?  A hard one?  Or something in the middle?
@match easy
Okay, if you're not past the 5th rank, then you'll probably be very happy to do a bit of community service.  The pirates are getting uppity:  this used to be a respectable town, and they're getting out of hand.  Go look around in some of the buildings near the docks, there are unsavory sorts running amok up there who should be taught good behavior!  There's also supposed to be a pirate treasure on some islands you can get to if you take passage on a pirate ship, but they seem to have moved their base over near Wolfsburg.
@match middle
Well, if you're past the 9th Tier in your guilds, and you have some strong friends, you might want to stop Yqreth from desolating more land than he already has.  He got his hands on a new spell, he does, and he's abusing it.  Turned to evil for sure, he has.  I've heard what some of his former servants have said about him.  If his soul doesn't belong to the Dark already, it will soon.  He resides in the Tower of the Stars, which is south of Scorn.  It's hard going to get there.
@match hard
If you're 12th rank or better, you might want to seek the Temple of Darkness.  You need a strong fighter along on the quest:  their god has granted their prayer to ban magic in his temple proper.  I battled one of their adepts for a time.  He had such incredible reserves of power that I had to withdraw from the fight.  I'm sure that he must have had a Power Crystal.  The Temple is in a Dark Forest just north of the Great East Road.

You can find his office on the west wing, he shouldn't be too far from it.

<li>Professor Ulote (9,4): <br /><pre>@match khelens
According to the few historical records we know, the Empire of Khelens was a big empire, many years ago.
Scorn and Navar were originally colonies from this Empire.
Unfortunately, something happened to it some millenia ago, all contact was lost, and no one really knows what happened to it.
@match world
@question khelens The Empire of Khelens?
Well, explaining everything would take really much time, time I don't have, sorry.
Let's just say that many cities are just colonies of the Empire of Khelens.
@match navar
@question khelens The Empire of Khelens?
@question scorn What about Scorn?
Navar was once a colony of Khelens.
After the loss of contact, both Navar and Scorn became rival for glory.
@match herghist
Herghist was a famour explorer, who travelled the world without seeking any glory.
@match darcap
@question herghist Herghist?
Ha, the lost colony of Darcap...
Initially, Darcap was a colony of the Kingdom of the Masts, left to survive when the kingdom disappeared.
It was forgotten for millenia, before the famous explorer Herghist arrived there about two thousand years ago.
@match scorn
@question khelens The Empire of Khelens?
@question ek What does 'EK' mean?
Scorn was the first colony of the Empire of Khelens to be established on this continent.
The founder was Skud the Great, in 435 EK.
In the next millenias, Scorn was destroyed a lot.
@match ek
@question khelens The Empire of Khelens?
Years are counted 'EK' based on the calendar of the Empire of Khelens.
The first year seems to correspond to the founding of the Empire.
@match *
@question world What do you know of the history of the world?
@question navar So, is the history of Navar interesting?
@question darcap Any idea about the history of Darcap?
@question scorn Do you know anything about the history of Scorn?
@question EK Do you happen to know what 'EK' means when we talk about years?

They trade the with dwarves for valuable gems and dwarvish craft.  They cannot travel because of the bandits.
@match bandits
I'm sure they would reward the brave man to rid the road of those scum!

That city to the west? Yes, it is said a great wizard founded that place. He was a master of the etheric.
@question wizard What wizard?
@question etheric What is this "etheric" of which you speak?
@match wizard
Skud the Great. He is long since departed from our plane of existence.
@match land
You wish to return to yours? A more powerful mage could perform a word of recall, but I am too frail. I doubt it possible to charter a ship from that great city of Navar to sail to your distant city.
@question ship Why wouldn't there be a ship to Scorn?
@match ship
Few captains long to explore, and it is expensive to form an expedition. In this age they fear far waters, Navar, most of all fears.
@match etheric
Kaladon, the wise, has dabbled in the etheric plane.  If he's not alseep, he may answer your question.

Ah, you wish to know the balm of travelling. Very dangerous it is. Reminds me of a story.
@match balm of travelling
You youngsters, always in a hurry with no time to hear my stories. If my memory serves me, you need the wing of a faerie dragon, freshy killed. Sing the rites of passage while adding in triplicate the water of sapphire, xan wing, & pixie wings. Stamp thrice upon the ground to bind the powers together. Apply the balm under a new moon and stamp thrice to invoke the portal. Do not wear metal, or the portal shall close!

Haa, Farnass, now that's a name I haven't heard in a while.  He was one of the best cook chiefs of the whole world.  Brother of the Mad Mage of Scorn, he shared with him passion for wizardry; yet his center of interest was much more focused on making tasty things and brewing nice beers.  Fifteen years ago his house just exploded.

Oh yes those whaling ships go to places colder than I'd ever want to venture.  This little island is as far south as I've ever been... and we dip below zero often enough that a man's blood starts to thin out real quick.
@match whale|whaling
Those whaling ships are built strong.  That's how you can tell them from others.  They often go deep into the frozen oceans and have outposts here and there.  One captain offered once to take me to a place at the bottom of the world... I declined as I probably would have died from the frost... but perhaps you could find such a captain to bring you along to one of there desolate islands... if you would want to.  In any case, the seas those ships ride upon are mighty rough and mighty cold; well below freezing all year round!

The giant army is from the Red Foot tribe. The Red Foots are located in the mountains north of the nearby inn.  If our dwarven brothers still live, they are likely being held there.

Some time after the battle against the ogres, a wizard arrived.  We do not know much about him, but it appears that he has chosen our outpost as his home.
We have heard battles raging upstairs, perhaps between the giants and the wizard's minions.  But the battles have been silent for some time now.
We would be most appreciative if you can help rid us of this new threat, but I am afraid we have no more reward to offer you.
@match *
Welcome!  We have been in hiding here since the giant army invaded our mining outpost.  The battle was bloody and many dwarves were captured.  Our only protection is this secret room and the spirits of our ancestors.

@question greenway What is this "Greenway"?
Although it may seem to be many places where you can find it, there is only one Dark Forest.  It is all connected - these connections are called The Greenway.
@match greenway
@question portal Where can I find a portal?
The Greenway of the forest spans the world (and some say even time itself).  The portals are hard to find and the paths are chaotic and dangerous.  Only the experienced may find their way.
@match enter|portal
Directly west of the Golden Yew you may find an entrance to The Greenway.

Greetings traveler.
@match temple
Ah yes, the temple along the northern wall.  That location is quite strange.  Almost as much as it's inhabitants.
@match location|strange
Why so interesting?  Because it was built on top of a grave site.
@match inhabitants|inhabitant|residents|tenants|troll|trolls
I can't for the life of me imagine why trolls would be so interested in a temple at that location.  They must not be followers of their typical god, Gnarg.  Maybe Devourers?
@match grave|grave site|graveyard
Oh yes, some of the Last Men who met their demise fleeing to here, Kingdom of Brittany before it was a kingdom, were entombed at that location.
@match last men
You have not hear the Lore of the Last Men?
@match lore|lore of the last men
Ah, well - I can share with you what I know.  The Last Men were a select group of people who fled Scorn after the Dragon Wars and the betrayel of the werebeasts.
@match dragon war|dragon wars
I know very little about that - just that Dragons once attacked Scorn and left it buried & ruined.
@match buried|ruined
As I said, I know very little - nothing more.
@match werebeasts|werebeast
The werebeasts hunted the Last Men as they fled Scorn to here.  The werebeasts were unable to survive the ice mountains and it's denizens.  Fortunately, most of the Last Men did.
@match administration
The ruling administration has a tolerance of all races here.
@match ice mountain|ice mountains
The legend has it - the mountains and icestorms appeared from nowhere.  As if they were summoned by mages.  How much truth bending took place for that tale?  One may never know.
@match gnarg
Gnarg is the god of trolls, goblins and even assassins.  You won't find too many civilized lands that accept temples of that kind.  I would flee in fear if the Administration here would allow the cult to set up here!
@match devourers
Devourers is the patron of the undead - mostly with wraiths who have returned to this world to finish what they could not accomplish when they were living.  Some embrace the darker side of Devourers, such as Necromancers and others in the dark arts.

Well there are two portals in his cave, that the old wizard Wist used to use as his laboratory.  The password is Kashu, the legendary warrior king.

They were the 3 most beautiful creatures to walk the earth once.  Together they had great magical powers of weaving - for they are the daughters of Aniu, god of making.  As they are half-goddesses each, no curse of any god may transmute them, but instead they have been mutilated.  They live now in sorrow in the tower my brothers protect.
@match tower|guard
We guard the tower of the sisters which lies within a maze of deadly creatures and false paths.  The ultimate true path is hidden.  Be careful if you choose to seek the tower!
@match password
Ah.. the entrance into the inner tower is protected by a password.  I used to know it when I was young but its been so many years that I have forgotten it.

Hello to you, and good day, please don't mind me, i'm just straightening up a bit.
@match doors|grates|password|key
So you're curious about how to pass these grates, eh? Well, so am I.  But the Elemental Masters have bound the doors with their names, and there's no getting the names out of them, no there's not!  Well, at least not for such as me.  And the elemental masters won't tell you their names either.  But each of the masters has a pet elemental that they use a lot.  Maybe if you ask the pets they'll talk.  They might not, though.  But elementals hate the sound of their own name, it strikes fear into them.  So if you can get the name of the elementals, you may be able to force them to tell you what you want.
@match thank you

I can look all over this country... So... I saw that the hideout of Eureca's family has been discovered by the monsters...
@match solve|answer
I didn't know anything about Gothwolte.  So I did some research.  Read the scrolls above.  I found out that Gothwolte is immune to everything.  Nothing can harm it.  So I told Eureca, "There is only one way to defeat it.  Travel to the Past, and kill Gothwolte before he bcomes invulnerable!"
@match trouble|start
One night, Eureca's castle was attacked by monsters.  Eureca defended his castle bravely, but Gothwolte, the leader of the attacking army was incredibly strong.  At last he gave up fighting Gothwolte.  He managed to escape with his family and servant.  He hid his Family in a secret room in the castle.  Then he and his servant, Cordish, came here to ask me how they could solve their disaster.
@match saving eureca
At first, I'll tell you how all of this trouble started...
@match yes
Find and save Eureca... I count on you!
@match cordish
He is one of Eureca's servants.  He looked scared and coward...
@match past
Eureca and his servant went to the past... and they didn't return yet... They must have gotten into trouble again... I am very concerned... Would you go to the past and save them?

Lickmond's sparring partner can be found in the "hard" training section.
