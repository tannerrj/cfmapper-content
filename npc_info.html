        <li>Qint (9, 12)<pre>@match mana|crystal
The mana crystal booths are used to recharge the mana crystals you may carry in your inventory. Go in the booth, stand over the crystal to gain mana, then transfer the mana to the crystals you carry by applying them. Beware that standing on or near the mana crystal too long can be fatal to your health.
@match cancellation
The cancellation booth is used to remove negative damage from your equipment. Enter the booth, stand between the directors and check your negative damaged equipment. Eventually all negative damage will be removed. Beware that the cancellation will also remove bonuses from your equipment. Do not carry any equipment in the cancellation booth that you don't intend to have adjusted.
@match *
Welcome to my shop. We have two mana crystal booths and a cancellation booth. Please feel free to ask me about them.

Hi there! I'm here to watch the dragons.  They are beautiful, don't you think? Oh yes, if you want a refreshment, I can tell you how to get more if all has been eaten up.
@match yes|dragon
One of the dragons will take you to the adventurous shop, directly to its more aggressive brethren.
@match refreshment|eat|tell|food|waybread|booze
For refreshments, place 7 gp on the northernmost of those three tables on the left, or place 25 gp for a waybread on the middle one.  For a booze, place 3 gp on the southernmost table.  The tables are magical, so you will be served even if I should not be here.

Proceed through the archway ahead and bring back the red key and choose a reward.
@question reward A reward, really?
@question key Can you tell me anything about the red key?
@match reward
Why yes, a reward.  To your left is a Potion of Healing - recover and heal yourself after a battle, and a Potion of Minor Potion of Life - recover lost stats after an untimely, but momentary death. To your right is a Potion of Shielding - protect you from physical attacks for a limited time, and a Potion of Heroism - a temporary boost to your strength, health, and quickness; great for combat during your many adventures.
@question key Can you tell me anything about the red key?
@match key|red
A sly and clever Gnoll Champion stole the key and I suspect he has it hidden somewhere in the dungeon.  Explore, use your might, use your wit.  Fight and survive and come back here to collect your prizes.

Proceed through the archway ahead and bring back the blue key and choose a reward.
@question reward A reward, really?
@question key Can you tell me anything about the blue key?
@match reward
Why yes, a reward.  To your left is a Potion of Healing - recover and heal yourself after a battle.  To your right is a Potion of Minor Life - recover lost stats after an untimely, but momentary death.
@question key Can you tell me anything about the blue key?
@match key|blue
A devious Ogre holds the key. But don't expect to find him too easily.  Explore, use your might, use your wit.  Fight and survive and come back here to collect your prize.

Greetings traveler.
@match temple
Ah yes, the temple along the northern wall.  That location is quite strange.  Almost as much as it's inhabitants.
@match location|strange
Why so interesting?  Because it was built on top of a grave site.
@match inhabitants|inhabitant|residents|tenants|troll|trolls
I can't for the life of me imagine why trolls would be so interested in a temple at that location.  They must not be followers of their typical god, Gnarg.  Maybe Devourers?
@match grave|grave site|graveyard
Oh yes, some of the Last Men who met their demise fleeing to here, Kingdom of Brittany before it was a kingdom, were entombed at that location.
@match last men
You have not hear the Lore of the Last Men?
@match lore|lore of the last men
Ah, well - I can share with you what I know.  The Last Men were a select group of people who fled Scorn after the Dragon Wars and the betrayel of the werebeasts.
@match dragon war|dragon wars
I know very little about that - just that Dragons once attacked Scorn and left it buried & ruined.
@match buried|ruined
As I said, I know very little - nothing more.
@match werebeasts|werebeast
The werebeasts hunted the Last Men as they fled Scorn to here.  The werebeasts were unable to survive the ice mountains and it's denizens.  Fortunately, most of the Last Men did.
@match administration
The ruling administration has a tolerance of all races here.
@match ice mountain|ice mountains
The legend has it - the mountains and icestorms appeared from nowhere.  As if they were summoned by mages.  How much truth bending took place for that tale?  One may never know.
@match gnarg
Gnarg is the god of trolls, goblins and even assassins.  You won't find too many civilized lands that accept temples of that kind.  I would flee in fear if the Administration here would allow the cult to set up here!
@match devourers
Devourers is the patron of the undead - mostly with wraiths who have returned to this world to finish what they could not accomplish when they were living.  Some embrace the darker side of Devourers, such as Necromancers and others in the dark arts.

If you want to become a priest of the Brave Goddess, but you can't pray, all you have to do is prove your faith by passing the test behind us, and She will gift you with a holy symbol blessed by Herself, which will allow you to pray at Her altar.  But beware, the test is not for beginners!

Valkyrie is the warrior goddess. She abhors all magic, unnatural creatures, and other similar abominations. Therefore Her priests are forbidden to use magic, even priest magic.  Priests of other gods say we're not real priests if we don't have divine magic, but don't be fooled - She grants us protection from filthy magic and blesses our weapons if we're faithful enough.

I am very happy that someone like you has finally come. What has happened is that the city is threatened from the east. The elf castle has grown great in power, the lord of that castle has suddenly turned against us. Another occurence that has cropped up is the increasing appearances of magical beings in the city... Dreads and beholders... some even in the fortifications of the city.
I cannot assault the castle myself... the elves with their dragon allies would burn this city to the ground... thus I need someone like you to sneak into the elven fortress. For his treason, I also want the head of the elf lord Valdak... and the head of his wife. To make sure there is no further uprising, slaughter everyone inside.
Your reward will be great.

Just drop a platinum coin on my desk and you'll have three tries on the targets behind me. We have three different targets:
easy one: Zombie Target,
mediocre: Vampire Target,
hard one: Demilich Target.
The more DIFFERENT targets you get with your 3 throws, the more prices are at your choice. Have a look at the exhibition to see what you can win.
Don't forget to collect your winnings BEFORE you have another go.
If you accidentally lost equipment behind my targets, I will try to retrieve your stuff when you pay the next coin. But I can't fetch weapons that stick IN a target.

Sometime after the battle against the ogres, a wizard arrived. We do not know much about him, but it appears that he has chosen our outpost as his home.
We have heard battles raging upstairs, perhaps between the giants and the wizard's minions. But the battles have been silent for some time now.
We would be most appreciative if you can help rid us of this new threat, but I am afraid we have no more reward to offer you.

This shrine is old.. older than the snakemen that you just slew.  I think they have only recently come back to worship the snake god here.  One snake priest spoke a little of my tongue and questioned me about a key to a door and 'eyes of the goddess.'

I did'nt know what the snake-priest was asking about.  I pretended to know so he would keep me alive.  I saw what those evil beings were doing to my friends (sob).

I am the Emissary of the Dragonlords to the City of Scorn. I have come to present the Demands of my masters. However, your King is less than cooperative. I should tell my masters that the city is ripe for conquering.
@match demand
The Dragonlords demand in tribute:
10 virgins per year,
100 head of cattle,
and 100000 pieces of gold
Such tribute would help them express kindness by refraining from destroying your squalid little city.
@match dragonlord|master
My masters, the Dragonlords, are most puissant. Few mortals may hope to overcome them in combat, for they wield such magics as would snuff the life of a mortal in seconds. No mortal can deal blows, arcane or otherwise, quickly enough to destroy the Lords, before they are destroyed. The only way a mortal could destroy one of the Dragonlords is by some clever device, for none may face one in straight combat to the death and live. To even challenge a Dragonlord to combat, you would have to pass all their draconic guards. The last of these is Ancient Dragons, whose teeth are spears, whose claws are swords, and whose breath is death! Would you know where the dragonlords dwell so that you might behold their magnificence?

It's almost directly to the northeast of Scorn - about 400 chains. The easiest way to get there is to take the north road outside of Scorn. Once you get past the lake, start heading east/northeast - you will need to climb over some mountains. If you run across a river, just start going north - keep going north past the like it flows from - about 75 chains. The castle is in a valley with some hills and woods.

That should do for a start. If you desire a harder challenge, try the wizards over there. They might have information. I wouldn't talk to the one in the corner unless you're 15th Tier or better in your guilds. He'll get you killed taking on things that could snuff you out with a sneeze!!!  Har har har!!!

Greetings. Just having a drink after I visited the Valley of the Three Sisters.
@match valley|sisters
Yes - a very nasty place. You should be at least 20th tier before you wander in, maybe a bit less if you have some friends. Do you want to know where it is located?
@match locate|location|located
It is in the mountain range West of Marksel. The mountains flatten out some to reveal a small lake.

You seem surprised to see a priest here drowning his sorrows in drink.  Well, my friends, I'm near despair.  Evil has taken my church from me; what was once holy is now perverted to evil.  Are you going to help me or are you here to just laugh at me?
@match help
Well, thank you.  I hope you have passed the Third Tier in your guilds otherwise helping me will be the death of you. My church is overrun by zombies.  If you can get rid of them, you may take anything of value you find there as a reward.  It's on the south side of town.

You suddenly feel you weren't worthy enough to ask...
@match hi|hello
Yes? What do you want?
All you adventurers are alike. Greedy as hell. You probably want me to tell you how to get your hands on some powerful magic, don't you? Well, that can be hard and dangerous. Got a death wish?  Eh?
@match yes|yup|aye
Well, maybe your greed will keep you alive, then. I've known some people who have dragged their bones out of the grave for greed. Smelly, and grumpy, everyone! Never underestimate the power of greed!  Well, I know of two places where you can get your hands on a powerful item. One I know for sure: a powerful magical Sword. The other I'm not sure of, but it's inside a mountain, I bet. Which do you want to hear about?
@match cave
I never explored his cave. If you can get past his pets and into his Chamber, you'll probably find something interesting. After the battle, the mountain was far too hot to be near, and I've had better things to do since then. I don't think you'll be able to pass his vicious pets unless you're at least 15th Tier in your guild. The mountain can be found north of the bend in the Great East Road.
@match mountain
I'll never forget that mountain. I fought a battle atop it with a dark spirit. His evil had begun to poison the land around his lair, so I challenged him to battle. When he issued forth from his cave to do battle with me, I rose into the air above him and blasted him with fire. He somehow survived that first blast, so I threw yet a greater at him.  He survived that one too, so I stretched myself. The next blast of fire scorched the mountain black (it remains so to this day). Yet still, he stood against me, so I thought he must somehow be immune. Using the last of my strength, I blasted him with lightning. He was destroyed, but I never looked into his cave.
@match sword
You've heard the rumors about the goings-on in Navar, at the end of the Great East Road?
Well, Morkov, the former Wizard there, has turned to darkness. He's out-and-out sold his soul. Kill him and take his Sword. He got it when he betrayed Navar and opened a gate for Evil to come through. The flood of the undead has taken over his Tower already. The idiot city council there hasn't taken action yet. Perhaps they're waiting for someone of the 13th or 14th Tier in their guilds to go kick Morkov out.

@match hi|hello
Yes?  Adventurers eh?  Wel,l what do you want?  Information?
@match yes|info
Yeah, that is what everyone does. They walk in here, and just because I'm sitting all alone they think they can pump me for information. Well, you're lucky, I'm actually in a talkative mood. So, what type of adventure are you looking for? An easy adventure? A hard one? Or something in the middle?
@match easy
Okay, if you're not past the 5th rank, then you'll probably be very happy to do a bit of community service. The pirates are getting uppity: this used to be a respectable town, and they're getting out of hand. Go look around in some of the buildings near the docks, unsavory sorts running amok up there who should be taught good behavior! There's also supposed to be a pirate treasure on some islands you can get to if you take passage on a pirate ship, but they seem to have moved their base over near Wolfsburg.
@match middle
Well, if you're past the 9th Tier in your guilds, and you have some strong friends, you might want to stop Yqreth from desolating more land than he already has. He got his hands on a new spell, he does, and he's abusing it. Turned to evil for sure, he has.  I've heard what some of his former servants have said about him. If his soul doesn't belong to the Dark already, it will soon. He resides in the Tower of the Stars, which is south of Scorn. It's hard going to get there.
@match hard
If you're 12th rank or better, you might want to seek the Temple of Darkness. You need a strong fighter along on the quest: their god has granted their prayer to ban magic in his temple proper. I battled one of their adepts for a time.  He had such incredible reserves of power that I had to withdraw from the fight. I'm sure that he must have had a Power Crystal. The Temple is in a Dark Forest just north of the Great East Road.

I didn't know anything about Gothwolte.  So I did some research.  Read the scrolls above.  I found out that Gothwolte is immune to everything.  Nothing can harm it.  So I told Eureca, "There is only one way to defeat it.  Travel to the Past, and kill Gothwolte before he bcomes invulnerable!"
@match trouble|start
One night, Eureca's castle was attacked by monsters.  Eureca defended his castle bravely, but Gothwolte, the leader of the attacking army was incredibly strong.  At last he gave up fighting Gothwolte.  He managed to escape with his family and servant.  He hid his Family in a secret room in the castle.  Then he and his servant, Cordish, came here to ask me how they could solve their disaster.

That city to the west? Yes, it is said a great wizard founded that place. He was a master of the etheric.

@question etheric What is this "etheric" of which you speak?
@match wizard
Skud the Great. He is long since departed from our plane of existence.
@match land
Do you wish to return to yours? A more powerful mage could perform a word of recall, but I am too frail. I doubt it possible to charter a ship from that great city of Navar to sail to your distant city.
@question ship Why wouldn't there be a ship to Scorn?
@match ship
Few captains long to explore, and it is expensive to form an expedition. In this age, they fear far waters, Navar, most of all fears.

@match balm of traveling
You youngsters, always in a hurry with no time to hear my stories. If my memory serves me, you need the wing of a faerie dragon, freshly killed. Sing the rites of passage while adding in triplicate the water of sapphire, xan wing, & pixie wings. Stamp thrice upon the ground to bind the powers together. Apply the balm under a new moon and stamp thrice to invoke the portal. Do not wear metal, or the portal shall close!

@match whale|whaling
Those whaling ships are built strong. That's how you can tell them from others. They often go deep into the frozen oceans and have outposts here and there. One captain offered once to take me to a place at the bottom of the world... I declined as I probably would have died from the frost... but perhaps you could find such a captain to bring you along to one of their desolate islands... if you would want to. In any case, the seas those ships ride upon are mighty rough and mighty cold; well below freezing all year round!

They were the 3 most beautiful creatures to walk the earth once.  Together they had great magical powers of weaving - for they are the daughters of Aniu, god of making.  As they are half-goddesses each, no curse of any god may transmute them, but instead they have been mutilated.  They live now in sorrow in the tower my brothers protect.

So you're curious about how to pass these grates, eh? Well, so am I.  But the Elemental Masters have bound the doors with their names, and there's no getting the names out of them, no there's not!  Well, at least not for such as me.  And the elemental masters won't tell you their names either.  But each of the masters has a pet elemental that they use a lot.  Maybe if you ask the pets they'll talk.  They might not, though.  But elementals hate the sound of their own name, it strikes fear into them.  So if you can get the name of the elementals, you may be able to force them to tell you what you want.
