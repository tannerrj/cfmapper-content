<p><b>Region's longname:</b> Astral Plane</p>
<p><b>Region description:</b> For eons, sages and scholars held the belief that the Astral Plane was devoid of any structures or life. Little did they realize; the realm is so massive that finding anything beyond mist and emptiness would take centuries. And that is where we are now â€“ the realm now has stable gateways and is ready for the brave and daring to explore.
