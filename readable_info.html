<p>This is a list of SIGN and BOOK with a special message.</p><ul>
<li>/brest/shops/buildshop</li>
<ul><li>sign (5,23): <br /><pre>Welcome to Acme. Inc construction shop!
You will find here everything you need to build your own customized home, sweet home.
Make sure to read our documentation on how to build nice maps.
</pre></li>
<li>Removing items (5,22): <br /><pre>To remove built items, you need a 'generic destroyer'.
Simply apply it, and fire in the desired direction. It will remove the first built item from the location.
Warning: a destroyer will remove items starting from the lowest order on the spot. Basically, this means the first removed item will be a pedestal (underground), then items on floor.
Note that the destroyer will not remove walls or floors.
</pre></li>
<li>Building gates and buttons/pedestals (5,21): <br /><pre>Some items, like gates, require buttons, pedestals, ..., something to be opened and closed.
To build a gate with its associated button:
* put a marking rune at the spot where you wish to build the door. The text can be whatever you want, make sure to remember it.
* build the gate on this spot
* put a marking rune at the spot where you with to put the button. Use the same text as for the door.
* build the button
Your button will now activate the gate when you apply it.
Note that you can link together as many gates, buttons, pedestals, as you want.
As long as you use the same text on the marking rune, they will all work together.
To build gates activated by other buttons, just use another text.
Normally all gates with a single marking rune text are either all up or all down at a given time, however if you want one open while another is closed, make use of inverted gates.
Also, it is possible to make buttons, levers, and pedestals underneath gates, however it requires things to be made in a specific order.
* make 2 marking runes on the square that you want to build the button and gate on
* build the gate first
* then build the button underneath it
This is useful for making a gate avoid crushing people underneath it. Also, you can use this same technique with inverted gates in order to make a square that pushes objects placed on it off of it.
</pre></li>
<li>Building floor and walls (5,20): <br /><pre>Building enables you to put walls and floors where you want.
Building a floor lets you remove walls. This is the only way to remove them.
You can change an existing floor by building another on top. Same goes for walls.
All created floors are magic, and will preserve items you put on them.
You can add a window in some walls. To remove the window, build a new wall.
</pre></li>
<li>Basic building instructions (4,23): <br /><pre>To build your own home, you can use different items:
* generic builder: this tool lets you build anything. You need one to build.
* generic destroyer: this tool lets you destroy a built item. This will remove any built item, except floors and walls.
* materials: you need those to build items. For instance, a 'Wood floor material' enables you to build a woodfloor.
To build an item:
* apply the builder
* mark the material of the item you want to build
* fire the builder in the desired direction
Of course, the material is used when you build, so you need to buy quite a few.
</pre></li>
<li>Building other items (4,22): <br /><pre>All items not requiring any special handling are built simply by marking the appropriate material and firing the builder.
Note that, to avoid any issue, those items can not be picked up.
Note also that you can build an item on another.
</pre></li>
<li>Building restrictions (4,21): <br /><pre>To build on a spot, all items on this spot must be 'buildable'.
Buildable items will display 'this is a buildable item' when examined.
There are several exceptions though. In all cases you can build on marking runes as they are used for making gates and buttons work together. Also you can build signs and talking books on of books and or scrolls, because they are needed for specifying the message. Also, buttons, levers and pedestals can be built underneath gates. Don't worry, you should have some clear messages on why you can't build.
</pre></li>
<li>Signs and talking books (4,20): <br /><pre>When making signs and talking (or listening) books, you need to place a book or scroll with the text you want on the square you're building on just like a marking rune.
With the talking/listening books, they will take the name and picture of the book used to create them as well.
For the talking and listening books, you also need to connect them with a marking rune just like gates buttons and levers, which in the case of the talking books, makes the book say it's message when activated, and in the case of listening books, it causes saying the phrase that the book looks for to act like pulling a lever.
For the listening books, the message must be in this format:
@match blah
Click.
Which will make it activate when somebody within two squares says "blah", and will additionally say "Click." upon activation.

<ul><li>About the Arena (18,21): <br /><pre>The Arena is a place where friends can fight each other without facing actual death penalties. Two players and 100 platinum are needed to enter; just go to the registration office to the north.
</pre></li>
<li>How it Works (18,20): <br /><pre>Before combat, both players are given the opportunity to set certain conditions, such as obstacles, for the match. They can also decide to place winning bets. Peaceful mode is automatically ignored. This means that you can attack your opponents by simply running into them. The one who is victorious will gain all of the treasure. This is not required. The winner also receives one finger of the defeated foe as a trophy for victory. Neither combatant will earn experience.
</pre></li>
<li>Safety (18,19): <br /><pre>The Arena Director takes safety very seriously. Because of this, the Arena is a very safe place. The loser will find himself in the first-aid station, with no loss of experience or stats. Moreoever, inside the arena, draining attacks don't take effect and acid doesn't harm equipment, so there is NOTHING to be afraid of.

</pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>/scorn/misc/beginners</li>
<ul><li>Type an A to read (15,28): <br /><pre>This is the beginning of a guided tour into Crossfire.  To fight monsters you run directly at them.  The sooner you kill them off the better.  Try standing on top of the handle at your right and press the 'A'-key.  The gate will then open and a monster will try to attack you.  Run directly toward it to knock it down.  Remember to put on your armour... Good luck!
</pre></li>
<li>Type an A to read (15,25): <br /><pre>You survived. That is promising ;->  As mentioned it is better the sooner you kill off the beasts.  That way they do not get so much time to hurt you.  To go really fast you can hold down the Control-key to run in a direction.  Try opening the gate at your right and run in by holding down the control-key and just pressing the direction key _once_.
</pre></li>
<li>Read by typing an A (15,22): <br /><pre>Practice to run with the Control-key down once more.  Speed is very important in this game.  Another thing that you should know is that to fight many beasts at once can be dangerous.  You may be badly injured before you manage to kill them all off.  Well, go practice now!
</pre></li>
<li>A A A A A .... (15,19): <br /><pre>It is time to get to know some other monsters.  Monsters generate from monster generators and you should try to destroy the generators as early as possible, to limit the number of monsters being produced.  So, open the gate at your right and destroy the face-shaped generator right away.  Do not waste time reading this ;-)
</pre></li>
<li>sign (15,16): <br /><pre>Not all monsters have generators and not all monsters need a generator to reproduce.  Sometimes you get a reward for winning a hard battle.  By the way: Chests are opened by pressing the key 'A' while standing on top of them or by pressing 'a' if you have it in your inventory.  The middle mouse button can also be used.  Try it out.
</pre></li>
<li>sign (15,13): <br /><pre>All doors are not the same.  Some need keys and some need strange button mechanisms :)  If you don't have a key, you can try to hack the door to pieces.  Beware of standing on a gate when it starts to go up.
</pre></li>
<li>sign (15,9): <br /><pre>Now you are on your own until the next sign.
</pre></li>
<li>sign (15,2): <br /><pre>Did you find anything?
</pre></li>
<li>sign (14,8): <br /><pre>Now let us see how well you do in _real_ combat.
Good luck!
</pre></li>
<li>sign (14,4): <br /><pre>Spell training area.  To cast a spell e.g. small fireball type: 'cast small fire
When you have done this you will notice that the Range line changes to: "spell (small fireball)"
You now do the same as you do when you fire arrows.  Hold down the SHIFT-key and press a direction key.  But beware. Spells can and often do hurt you...
</pre></li>
<li>sign (14,1): <br /><pre>Here you can test your shooting weapons or spells if you possess any.  If you have readied a bow and have some arrows handy, you can fire by holding the SHIFT-key down while pressing a direction.  Your arrows fly for ever if they do not hit anything.  Make sure you pick up your arrows. Arrows easily burn ... You apply a bow by clicking on it with the middle mouse button.
</pre></li>
<li>sign (9,4): <br /><pre>Go get the wand, apply it, open the gate, fire at the monsters and RUN! CAREFUL: YOU MAY HURT YOURSELF ...

<ul><li>Notice (33,59): <br /><pre>At the entrance to the vault is a circular marble area.  Parts of the white marble are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  These correspond to the first number on your combo-cards (ie: the 1 in 1:4). The fruit here correspond to the second number of your combo-cards (ie: the 4 in 1:4).  If you had a combo card that said 1:4 you would place a clover on the marble tile that said 1.  You do this for each of the combinations on your combo-cards.  Once all is entered the vault will open if it was done in the correct sequence (tile 1 then 2 then 3...).  Don't loose your combo-cards.  Don't enter the combo too fast.  To lock the vault once you're done enter an incorrect digit on one of the number floors, the vault will lockdown.

<li>Boat Racing Explanation (3,8): <br /><pre>The objective of this game is to be the first one to the finish line.  To play, have every racer position themself at the starting gate and then someone say 'start'.  This causes the gate to open.  After it opens, go to the right towards the finish line as fast as you can, but watch out for the jagged rocks and randomly generated 'strange water' which slows you down.  In order to tell who won, look at the order of the 'Racer x has finished!' and see who was first.
</pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>/darcap/darcap/circus/fz_boulderball</li>
<ul><li>Boulderball Explanation (44,11): <br /><pre>To play boulderball, form two teams (a team can be 1-4 players) and have one team gather on one group of pentagrams, and the other team on the other, then say 'start' to be teleported in.  The goal of this game is to push the Boulderball into the opposing team's goal (reference the signs by the starting boxes for location information).  The game is won at 1 point, so upon a team scoring a goal, both teams are teleported out, and the winning team is declared.  (Warning: no tiles anywhere on this map are arena tiles, meaning that any kills anywhere on this map will be a PK with the usual penalties, so please do not do that.)  (Note: do not worry about accidentally pushing the boulder against a wall rendering it stuck--the wall lining denies boulders.  Also, players cannot stand inside the goal, to prevent them from just sitting right in there to block it.)  (Note: the teams start in a line in between the ball and their goal to prevent one team from just drilling the Boulderball into the opponent's goal right off the start.)
</pre></li>
<li>Team 2 Starting Box (39,14): <br /><pre>This is the Team 2 starting box.  If you are Team 2, your opponents' goal is on the right side of the court.

</li>
<li>/darcap/darcap/circus/fz_dlobby</li>
<ul><li>Deathmatch Explanation (6,5): <br /><pre>This is the Deathmatch lobby.  Deathmatch is similar to arena dueling, except it is really laid back.  It is not restricted to 2 people at once... any number of people can play.  Also, it is open, meaning anyone can enter and leave whenever they want.  There are no trophies for killing either, since it is so unofficial and laid back.  Also, the fighting areas are much larger than the traditional arena, and offer varying circumstances to fight under.
</pre></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>/darcap/darcap/circus/fz_d1</li>
<ul><li>sign (59,30): <br /><pre>There are multiple entrances to the Deathmatch area, but only one exit (near the center).  This is to help fight against entrance/exit camping/popping in and out while casting.  Also note that the entrances are laid out in this room similar to how they are in the Deathmatch area, location wise.

<ul><li>Obstacle Course Explanation (3,5): <br /><pre>This is the obstacle course lobby.  Each obstacle course here is a 1-player course, filled with dangerous traps and obstacles meant to stop you from making it to the end.  To enter an obstacle course, stand on the teleporter and say 'start'.

<li>Sphere Racing Explanation (38,27): <br /><pre>To play Sphere Racing, have 1 player enter Sphere 1, and another player enter Sphere 2, then maneuver both spheres to their respective starting positions (Sphere 1 on left, Sphere 2 on right).  A few moments after that is achieved, the starting gate will open.  The objective is to race the other person to the finish line.  When a player passes over the finish line, it will be declared to all on this map that he has finished.  In order to tell who won, see which player's message came first in the message box.  Also note that there are randomly generated obstacles to hinder you and to prevent scripts from being effective.

<li>/darcap/darcap/circus/fz_sumowrestling</li>
<ul><li>Sumo Wrestling Explanation (24,8): <br /><pre>To play Sumo Wrestling, have one player stand on one pentagram, and another player on the other, and then wait a few moments.  Once that is achieved, both players will be teleported into the wrestling area. The goal of this game is to push your opponent outside of the wrestling area (onto the 'battleground' tiles) which will cause them to lose, and die (there is no death penalty though).  The remaining player will be teleported out upon victory. (WARNING: the only way this map can work is to have *only* the fatal/out-of-boundary area as arena tiles, that means if you use magic or go hostile and end up killing someone in the wrestling area or outside the safety fence, it will be a PK with the usual penalty, so please do not do that.

To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

<li>Owner's Guide (27,9): <br /><pre>Welcome to your storage building.  This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

<ul><li>How to buy a Guild (32,22): <br /><pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

<li>Owners Guide (12,14): <br /><pre>Welcome to your new Guild House!
A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com

<ul><li>How to buy a Guild (32,22): <br /><pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

<ul><li>How to buy a Guild (32,22): <br /><pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

<li>Owners Guide (12,14): <br /><pre>Welcome to your new Guild House!
A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

<li>Owners Guide (12,14): <br /><pre>Welcome to your new Guild House!
A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

<ul><li>How to buy a Guild (32,22): <br /><pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

<li>Owner's Guide (27,9): <br /><pre>Welcome to your storage building.  This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

<ul><li>How to buy a Guild (32,22): <br /><pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

<li>Owners Guide (12,14): <br /><pre>Welcome to your new Guild House!
A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

<ul><li>How to buy a Guild (32,22): <br /><pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

<li>magic_mouth (9,30): <br /><pre>Priest
As a priest, you've learned an intense devotion to your god, and you've learned how to channel the energies your god vouchsafes to his devotees.
You've been taught the use of weapons, but only cursorily, and your physical training has been lacking in general.
Since you're in tune with the holy powers, you can tell when a god has marked an object as accursed.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,28): <br /><pre>Paladin
You are a militant priest, with an emphasis on 'priest'.
You've been taught archery and the use of weapons, but great care has been taken that you're doctrinally correct.  Now you've been sent out in the world to convert the unrighteous and destroy the enemies of the faith.  Your church members have been charged a pretty penny to equip you for the job!
All other areas of your education have been neglected.  Perhaps aware of your deficiency, your superiors have given you some measure of protection from magic.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,26): <br /><pre>Monk
In the Monastery, they believed in mental discipline and peace through physical training, meditation, and, to a lesser extent, religious devotion.
Your mental equilibrium requires you to forego the use of weapons, but your physical training in karate means you're not helpless.
Your inner peace grants you the ability to regenerate faster and to sense metaphysical auras.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,24): <br /><pre>Thief
Trained to be a thief from a young age, you've learned to steal and you're familiar with the value a fence will give you on your "finds".
You've had some weaponry training, including archery; this being advisable to someone who is likely to have acrimonious disagreements about the ownership of valuable objects.
You've had no time for either religious devotion or the study of magecraft, but your quick wits have been enough to keep you alive so far.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,22): <br /><pre>Ninja
As a member of the secret society of the Ninja, you've been taught archery, the use of weapons, and also the art of combat without weapons.  Your style of combat, leans very much toward the sneak attack, so you've been taught how to be inconspicuous and to appear in places you're not expected.
You have had no introduction to either religious devotion or magic.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,20): <br /><pre>Swashbuckler
Shipboard most of your life, you've learned good balance and agility, and you've also become strong and hardy.  Because of occasional oars work, you and your shipmates have an admirable command of rhythm, and you can sing well.
You've learned to make the most of your time in port:  after passing out drunk in a bar and waking to find yourself short your pay, you've found ways to acquire new capital, or at the very least, talk someone into helping you out of your fix.
On numerous occasions, you've taken up arms and bow in defense of your ship, so you're facile with weapons, but you've had no chance to learn magic or the ways of gods.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,18): <br /><pre>Barbarian
Growing up in the howling wilderness, you've had no chance to pursue anything remotely intellectual, let alone learn your letters!  It's amazing you ever thought of leaving your hovel and going somewhere else, you're so ignorant.  But now you have.
You find that you're a lot tougher and stronger than these city folk, and you know how to get around in rough terrain.  You've learned archery in order to fill your cook pot, and weaponry is second nature to anyone who's had to fight with the local orc-tribe over food once a month.
You're deeply afraid of magic, and it'll be a while before you get over that and develop any facility with it.
You've no deep problem with the idea of gods, but you don't know much about them.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,16): <br /><pre>Warrior
As a Warrior you've been trained in the art of combat with weapons and in archery.
Because of your training, you're stronger, more agile, and hardier than you would be otherwise.
Your education, however, has not included studies in the magical arts or religious devotion, and, in general, lacks breadth.

<li>magic_mouth (7,14): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #6.
Religions
Religions are acquired by praying at an altar.  Any player with the praying skill may pray at an altar and become a devotee of that god.
The deities are very different from each other and can vastly affect how the game is played.  Beginning players should probably choose either Mostrai or Valriel, and should probably avoid Gaea and Ruggilli.
Praying at an altar can have a number of advantages.  For example, your god may grant you extra grace points, or may spontaneously bless you with some unexpected boon.  Don't give up on praying at the altar as sometimes it takes quite a bit of prayer to convince your god that you are worthy.
Temples for most of the religions may be found in the town of Scorn, where new players should go after selecting a class.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,14): <br /><pre>To begin choosing a character class, walk into the room ahead.  Examine the different classes by stepping on the first tile of each aisle.  When you find a class that appeals to you, walk forward onto the teleport circle for that class.  At that point, your character usually assumes the appearance of the fellow standing at the end of the aisle.
Note that your character's statistics like strength, dexterity, and so on, will be automatically adjusted according the chosen class.  Keep this in mind when making a selection. Some statistics will get higher, and others will get lower.
It may be helpful to choose a class keeping in mind which statistics are high and low.  For example, it may not be wise to pick a warrior class if your character has very low strength, and electing a magical class with a very low power statistic may prevent your character from using magic until artifacts may be found that raise your characters statistics to a useful level.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,13): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #5:
Prayers
Players with the praying skill can ask help of their gods.  Prayers and magical spells are used in much the same way as magic spells.  For example:
cast holy word
cast cause light wounds
These commands set a ranged attack to that prayer.  Then, like other ranged weapons, the spell is "fired" in a direction to invoke the prayer.  The "invoke" command also works with praying spells.
Grace is a measure of how pleased your god is with you at the moment.  Your god will grant you favors if you have sufficient grace, or even sometimes when you don't.
Asking for a big favor when you have insufficient grace may bring down divine retribution, so watch your grace meter when casting spells.
Grace is slowly replenished, up to a point.  You must pray to gain more grace, or gain it faster than the natural replenishment rate.  The following command may be used to set up a convenient way to pray:
bind use_skill praying
P
This is called keybinding, and sets up a hotkey for a commonly entered text command.  After binding the command to the P key, pressing P causes your character to pray.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,12): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #4:
Magic
Players with magical skills may cast mana-based spells.  Magic skills are split into sub-groups called evocation, pyromancy, sorcery, and summoning, and are used by typing commands.  For example:
cast small lightning
cast burning hands
The cast command "readies" a spell and selects a ranged attack to prepare for "firing" magic.  To invoke the spell, fire, or shoot, in some direction after it has been readied.  It is also possible to invoke a spell without having to fire or ready it.  For example:
invoke word of recall
invoke small lightning
Using the invoke command does not change the melee or ranged weapon selection.
Magical energy is called mana and is depleted whenever a player invokes a magical spell.   Mana is normally replenished slowly, but certain items may speed the recharging process.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,11): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #3:
Skills
Crossfire players can have many skills.  Type in the command "skills" to see which ones you have.  Remember, the apostrophe key is used to begin entering typed commands.  At the moment your character will have few or no skills.  Selecting your character class is the way to choose your beginning skill set.
The primary skills are organized into groups that represent abilities to use various forms of magic, weapons, and praying, but there are also many other skills that do not fall into these broad categories.
Some skills are used by typing in commands like this:
use_skill alchemy
Other skills, like praying, weapons, and magic are used automatically.  Skills may be inherent to your character, but they may also be acquired by using items like talismans, holy symbols, or other inventory items.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,10): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #2:
Basic movement and melee combat.
During your adventures, you often need to battle monsters.  If you want to physically strike a monster, just run into him with your player, many times, and quickly.  This is called melee combat.  To combat foes or escape with your life, learn the keyboard commands for running and moving.
Move using the following keys, or by using arrow key clusters or numeric key pads present on many keyboards:
yku
h l
bjn
To run, hold the <Ctrl> key and press a direction key.  When you run, it is not necessary to repeatedly press direction keys.  You move in the indicated direction until the direction key is released.
It is better to hit a monster with a weapon rather than with fists.  Click on your inventory until you figure out how to get a weapon "wielded".  Once that is done, you'll be able to hit the monster with the weapon when you run into him.
Melee combat can be very effective, but be careful.  Some monsters do a great deal of damage to character and equipment during close combat, and yet others are unaffected by physical damage, though these monsters do not appear in the easy dungeons you will play first.
To avoid melee combat, use ranged weapons like bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, or magic.  Fire such ranged weapons by pressing the <Shift> key in combination with a direction key.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,9): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #1:
How to pick up, drop, and apply things.
On this square there is a piece of food.  Click around with various mouse buttons.  One of the buttons will cause you to apply (eat) the food.  Another button is used to pick up or drop items.  It is important to get comfortable with pickup and drop early so that you do not accidentally drop things that are given to you after you select a class.  Some of those items will disappear forever if you drop them.
The mouse is not the only way to do things.  Keyboard keys are used also.  For example, the "," (comma) key is quick way to pick up objects you are standing on.
Crossfire also has a rich set of text commands.  To begin entering a text command, use the apostrophe (') key.  On most modern clients, this places your cursor in a text entry box.
To pick up, drop, or apply objects, type an apostrophe followed by an appropriate text command.  For example, typing a text command "take all" gets everything off of the floor at once.

<li>magic_mouth (7,8): <br /><pre>Welcome to the Hall of Selection.
Here you pick a character class.  Each class starts out with different skills.  Picking a class here does not permanently affect the skills you know as it is quite possible to 'train' your character in additional skills.  Like a person, a character can learn a new career if his native abilities allow it.
Selection of a class also affects the appearance of your character on the game board.  Even though a character may assume a new vocation by learning new skills, the appearance chosen here is permanent.
On this walk toward your destiny, some basic game concepts will be offered to prepare you for your adventures.  Do not worry too much about all the details yet.  After you select a class, you will have another chance to learn more about how to start playing Crossfire.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,28): <br /><pre>Devotee
The axis of your existence is your devotion to your god, but you've also been busy in other areas.
Your sensitivity to godly powers has also caused your natural magical ability to bloom, and your religious order has encouraged your study.
Your religious superiors have forced you to learn weaponry against your choice, but you will find that they were wise to do so.  You haven't trained as assiduously as you should have, so you are soft and weak.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,26): <br /><pre>Sorcerer
Your study of magic has been obsessive.  Your frequent practice has greatly enhanced your powers, and your intellect has been sharpened enormously by your quest for ever better ways to channel energies.
Barbarians used to push you around on the street until you blasted one's leg off with a lightning bolt.  You reflected later on the stupidity of this, because you could by no means have blasted his friends, too.  Fortunately, they ran off.  You resolved to learn how to take out a whole group of barbarians before losing your temper again.
On the other hand, you have totally neglected to learn to use weaponry, so you're soft and weak.
Your study of magical devices allows you to notice when an object has a magical aura, and you are often able to fathom the purpose of magical devices.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,24): <br /><pre>Alchemist
Your specialty is magical devices and concoctions, but you've also had some training in weaponry, so that you could fend off townsfolk angered by the vile reeks that frequently emanate from your workshop.
Searching for the ultimate recipe and trying to recover lost knowledge has sharpened your wits considerably.
Your focus, however, has left little time for physical training, and your sedentary lifestyle has weakened you.
Your dependence on magical devices extends to the use of a talisman to channel mana.  The talisman has become attuned to detonation and transmutation because of the way you have used it.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,22): <br /><pre>Wizard
You're the generalist of the spellcasters.  You've emphasized the use of magic and studied all its areas equally.
You've learned something about the gods and religious devotion as well.
To a much lesser extent, you've studied weaponry, but you've not had much physical training:  you're mostly sedentary, and so you're not nearly so strong and healthy as you could be.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,20): <br /><pre>Summoner
You've had more of an emphasis on physical training than most spellcasters, at the expense of less practice with spellcasting.  You've never learned to use magic innately, but instead rely on a magic talisman to channel mana for you.
Your work has leaned heavily toward the art of summoning creatures to help you in a fight, and your talisman has become attuned to that.  That attunement, however, makes it harder for you to reject unwanted creatures.
You've also had a reasonable education in religious devotion.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,18): <br /><pre>Evoker
Your specialty is the use of attack spells in combat.  You practice these spells daily, and your capacity to cast them has increased hugely.
You've had some training in weaponry to help defend yourself, but you tend to leave most of the fighting to others, so your physical training has been somewhat lacking.
You've never learned to use magic innately, but instead rely on a magic talisman to channel mana for you.  The attack spells have imprinted themselves somewhat on your talisman, making it good for those and less useful for anything else.
You have not been trained in religious devotion:  however, you come from a religious family and will have no particular difficulty taking up the service of a god.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,16): <br /><pre>Warlock
You've divided your time between learning magic and learning weapons, but have totally disregarded religious devotion.
You're physically stronger and hardier because of your training, and you know the use of weapons and bows.  However, you're just a bit clumsy in both weaponry and magic because you've had to divide your time between them.

Since you're in tune with the holy powers, you can tell when a god has marked an object as accursed.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,28): <br /><pre>Paladin
You are a militant priest, with an emphasis on 'priest'.
You've been taught archery and the use of weapons, but great care has been taken that you're doctrinally correct.  Now you've been sent out in the world to convert the unrighteous and destroy the enemies of the faith.  Your church members have been charged a pretty penny to equip you for the job!
All other areas of your education have been neglected.  Perhaps aware of your deficiency, your superiors have given you some measure of protection from magic.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,26): <br /><pre>Monk
In the Monastery, they believed in mental discipline and peace through physical training, meditation, and, to a lesser extent, religious devotion.

Your inner peace grants you the ability to regenerate faster and to sense metaphysical auras.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,24): <br /><pre>Thief
Trained to be a thief from a young age, you've learned to steal and you're familiar with the value a fence will give you on your "finds".
You've had some weaponry training, including archery; this being advisable to someone who is likely to have acrimonious disagreements about the ownership of valuable objects.
You've had no time for either religious devotion or the study of magecraft, but your quick wits have been enough to keep you alive so far.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,22): <br /><pre>Ninja
As a member of the secret society of the Ninja, you've been taught archery, the use of weapons, and also the art of combat without weapons.  Your style of combat, leans very much toward the sneak attack, so you've been taught how to be inconspicuous and to appear in places you're not expected.
You have had no introduction to either religious devotion or magic.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,20): <br /><pre>Swashbuckler
Shipboard most of your life, you've learned good balance and agility, and you've also become strong and hardy.  Because of occasional oars work, you and your shipmates have an admirable command of rhythm, and you can sing well.
You've learned to make the most of your time in port:  after passing out drunk in a bar and waking to find yourself short your pay, you've found ways to acquire new capital, or at the very least, talk someone into helping you out of your fix.
On numerous occasions, you've taken up arms and bow in defense of your ship, so you're facile with weapons, but you've had no chance to learn magic or the ways of gods.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,18): <br /><pre>Barbarian
Growing up in the howling wilderness, you've had no chance to pursue anything remotely intellectual, let alone learn your letters!  It's amazing you ever thought of leaving your hovel and going somewhere else, you're so ignorant.  But now you have.
You find that you're a lot tougher and stronger than these city folk, and you know how to get around in rough terrain.  You've learned archery in order to fill your cook pot, and weaponry is second nature to anyone who's had to fight with the local orc-tribe over food once a month.
You're deeply afraid of magic, and it'll be a while before you get over that and develop any facility with it.
You've no deep problem with the idea of gods, but you don't know much about them.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,16): <br /><pre>Warrior
As a Warrior you've been trained in the art of combat with weapons and in archery.
Because of your training, you're stronger, more agile, and hardier than you would be otherwise.
Your education, however, has not included studies in the magical arts or religious devotion, and, in general, lacks breadth.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,15): <br /><pre>To begin choosing a character class, walk into the room ahead.  Examine the different classes by stepping on the first tile of each aisle.  When you find a class that appeals to you, walk forward onto the teleport circle for that class.
Note that your character's statistics like strength, dexterity, and so on, will be automatically adjusted according the chosen class.  Keep this in mind when making a selection. Some statistics will get higher, and others will get lower.
It may be helpful to choose a class keeping in mind which statistics are high and low.  For example, it may not be wise to pick a warrior class if your character has very low strength, and electing a magical class with a very low power statistic may prevent your character from using magic until artifacts may be found that raise your characters statistics to a useful level.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,14): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #6.
Religions
Religions are acquired by praying at an altar.  Any player with the praying skill may pray at an altar and become a devotee of that god.
The deities are very different from each other and can vastly affect how the game is played.  Beginning players should probably choose either Mostrai or Valriel, and should probably avoid Gaea and Ruggilli.
Praying at an altar can have a number of advantages.  For example, your god may grant you extra grace points, or may spontaneously bless you with some unexpected boon.  Don't give up on praying at the altar as sometimes it takes quite a bit of prayer to convince your god that you are worthy.
Temples for most of the religions may be found in the town of Scorn, where new players should go after selecting a class.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,13): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #5:
Prayers
Players with the praying skill can ask help of their gods.  Prayers and magical spells are used in much the same way as magic spells.  For example:
cast holy word
cast cause light wounds
These commands set a ranged attack to that prayer.  Then, like other ranged weapons, the spell is "fired" in a direction to invoke the prayer.  The "invoke" command also works with praying spells.
Grace is a measure of how pleased your god is with you at the moment.  Your god will grant you favors if you have sufficient grace, or even sometimes when you don't.
Asking for a big favor when you have insufficient grace may bring down divine retribution, so watch your grace meter when casting spells.
Grace is slowly replenished, up to a point.  You must pray to gain more grace, or gain it faster than the natural replenishment rate.  The following command may be used to set up a convenient way to pray:
bind use_skill praying
P
This is called keybinding, and sets up a hotkey for a commonly entered text command.  After binding the command to the P key, pressing P causes your character to pray.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,12): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #4:
Magic
Players with magical skills may cast mana-based spells.  Magic skills are split into sub-groups called evocation, pyromancy, sorcery, and summoning, and are used by typing commands.  For example:
cast small lightning
cast burning hands
The cast command "readies" a spell and selects a ranged attack to prepare for "firing" magic.  To invoke the spell, fire, or shoot, in some direction after it has been readied.  It is also possible to invoke a spell without having to fire or ready it.  For example:
invoke word of recall
invoke small lightning
Using the invoke command does not change the melee or ranged weapon selection.
Magical energy is called mana and is depleted whenever a player invokes a magical spell.   Mana is normally replenished slowly, but certain items may speed the recharging process.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,11): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #3:
Skills
Crossfire players can have many skills.  Type in the command "skills" to see which ones you have.  Remember, the apostrophe key is used to begin entering typed commands.  At the moment your character will have few or no skills.  Selecting your character class is the way to choose your beginning skill set.
The primary skills are organized into groups that represent abilities to use various forms of magic, weapons, and praying, but there are also many other skills that do not fall into these broad categories.
Some skills are used by typing in commands like this:
use_skill alchemy
Other skills, like praying, weapons, and magic are used automatically.  Skills may be inherent to your character, but they may also be acquired by using items like talismans, holy symbols, or other inventory items.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,10): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #2:
Basic movement and melee combat.
During your adventures, you often need to battle monsters.  If you want to physically strike a monster, just run into him with your player, many times, and quickly.  This is called melee combat.  To combat foes or escape with your life, learn the keyboard commands for running and moving.
Move using the following keys, or by using arrow key clusters or numeric key pads present on many keyboards:
yku
h l
bjn
To run, hold the <Ctrl> key and press a direction key.  When you run, it is not necessary to repeatedly press direction keys.  You move in the indicated direction until the direction key is released.
It is better to hit a monster with a weapon rather than with fists.  Click on your inventory until you figure out how to get a weapon "wielded".  Once that is done, you'll be able to hit the monster with the weapon when you run into him.
Melee combat can be very effective, but be careful.  Some monsters do a great deal of damage to character and equipment during close combat, and yet others are unaffected by physical damage, though these monsters do not appear in the easy dungeons you will play first.
To avoid melee combat, use ranged weapons like bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, or magic.  Fire such ranged weapons by pressing the <Shift> key in combination with a direction key.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,9): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #1:
How to pick up, drop, and apply things.
On this square there is a piece of food.  Click around with various mouse buttons.  One of the buttons will cause you to apply (eat) the food.  Another button is used to pick up or drop items.  It is important to get comfortable with pickup and drop early so that you do not accidentally drop things that are given to you after you select a class.  Some of those items will disappear forever if you drop them.
The mouse is not the only way to do things.  Keyboard keys are used also.  For example, the "," (comma) key is quick way to pick up objects you are standing on.
Crossfire also has a rich set of text commands.  To begin entering a text command, use the apostrophe (') key.  On most modern clients, this places your cursor in a text entry box.
To pick up, drop, or apply objects, type an apostrophe followed by an appropriate text command.  For example, typing a text command "take all" gets everything off of the floor at once.  You can even be more specific by using an objects name.  For example, "drop food" will cause all items named food to be dropped.

The deities are very different from each other and can vastly affect how the game is played.  Beginning players should probably choose either Mostrai or Valriel, and should probably avoid Gaea and Ruggilli.
Praying at an altar can have a number of advantages.  For example, your god may grant you extra grace points, or may spontaneously bless you with some unexpected boon.  Don't give up on praying at the altar as sometimes it takes quite a bit of prayer to convince your god that you are worthy.
Temples for most of the religions may be found in the town of Scorn, where new players should go after selecting a class.

Prayers
Players with the praying skill can ask help of their gods.  Prayers and magical spells are used in much the same way as magic spells.  For example:
cast holy word
cast cause light wounds
These commands set a ranged attack to that prayer.  Then, like other ranged weapons, the spell is "fired" in a direction to invoke the prayer.  The "invoke" command also works with praying spells.
Grace is a measure of how pleased your god is with you at the moment.  Your god will grant you favors if you have sufficient grace, or even sometimes when you don't.
Asking for a big favor when you have insufficient grace may bring down divine retribution, so watch your grace meter when casting spells.
Grace is slowly replenished, up to a point.  You must pray to gain more grace, or gain it faster than the natural replenishment rate.  The following command may be used to set up a convenient way to pray:
bind use_skill praying
P
This is called keybinding, and sets up a hotkey for a commonly entered text command.  After binding the command to the P key, pressing P causes your character to pray.

<li>magic_mouth (7,12): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #4:
Magic
Players with magical skills may cast mana-based spells.  Magic skills are split into sub-groups called evocation, pyromancy, sorcery, and summoning, and are used by typing commands.  For example:
cast small lightning
cast burning hands
The cast command "readies" a spell and selects a ranged attack to prepare for "firing" magic.  To invoke the spell, fire, or shoot, in some direction after it has been readied.  It is also possible to invoke a spell without having to fire or ready it.  For example:
invoke word of recall
invoke small lightning
Using the invoke command does not change the melee or ranged weapon selection.
Magical energy is called mana and is depleted whenever a player invokes a magical spell.   Mana is normally replenished slowly, but certain items may speed the recharging process.

<li>magic_mouth (7,11): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #3:
Skills
Crossfire players can have many skills.  Type in the command "skills" to see which ones you have.  Remember, the apostrophe key is used to begin entering typed commands.  At the moment your character will have few or no skills.  Selecting your character class is the way to choose your beginning skill set.
The primary skills are organized into groups that represent abilities to use various forms of magic, weapons, and praying, but there are also many other skills that do not fall into these broad categories.
Some skills are used by typing in commands like this:
use_skill alchemy
Other skills, like praying, weapons, and magic are used automatically.  Skills may be inherent to your character, but they may also be acquired by using items like talismans, holy symbols, or other inventory items.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (7,10): <br /><pre>Crossfire Primer #2:
Basic movement and melee combat.
During your adventures, you often need to battle monsters.  If you want to physically strike a monster, just run into him with your player, many times, and quickly.  This is called melee combat.  To combat foes or escape with your life, learn the keyboard commands for running and moving.
Move using the following keys, or by using arrow key clusters or numeric key pads present on many keyboards:
yku
h l
bjn
To run, hold the <Ctrl> key and press a direction key.  When you run, it is not necessary to repeatedly press direction keys.  You move in the indicated direction until the direction key is released.
It is better to hit a monster with a weapon rather than with fists.  Click on your inventory until you figure out how to get a weapon "wielded".  Once that is done, you'll be able to hit the monster with the weapon when you run into him.
Melee combat can be very effective, but be careful.  Some monsters do a great deal of damage to character and equipment during close combat, and yet others are unaffected by physical damage, though these monsters do not appear in the easy dungeons you will play first.
To avoid melee combat, use ranged weapons like bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, or magic.  Fire such ranged weapons by pressing the <Shift> key in combination with a direction key.

How to pick up, drop, and apply things.
On this square there is a piece of food.  Click around with various mouse buttons.  One of the buttons will cause you to apply (eat) the food.  Another button is used to pick up or drop items.  It is important to get comfortable with pickup and drop early so that you do not accidentally drop things that are given to you after you select a class.  Some of those items will disappear forever if you drop them.
The mouse is not the only way to do things.  Keyboard keys are used also.  For example, the "," (comma) key is quick way to pick up objects you are standing on.
Crossfire also has a rich set of text commands.  To begin entering a text command, use the apostrophe (') key.  On most modern clients, this places your cursor in a text entry box.
To pick up, drop, or apply objects, type an apostrophe followed by an appropriate text command.  For example, typing a text command "take all" gets everything off of the floor at once.  You can even be more specific by using an objects name.  For example, "drop food" will cause all items named food to be dropped.

<li>magic_mouth (7,8): <br /><pre>Welcome to the Hall of Selection.
Here you pick a character class.  Each class starts out with different skills.  Picking a class here does not permanently affect the skills you know as it is quite possible to 'train' your character in additional skills.  Like a person, a character can learn a new career if his native abilities allow it.
On this walk toward your destiny, some basic game concepts will be offered to prepare you for your adventures.  Do not worry too much about all the details yet.  After you select a class, you will have another chance to learn more about how to start playing Crossfire.

<li>magic_mouth (5,35): <br /><pre>Devotee
The axis of your existence is your devotion to your god, but you've also been busy in other areas.
Your sensitivity to godly powers has also caused your natural magical ability to bloom, and your religious order has encouraged your study.
Your religious superiors have forced you to learn weaponry against your choice, but you will find that they were wise to do so.  You haven't trained as assiduously as you should have, so you are soft and weak.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,33): <br /><pre>Sorcerer
Your study of magic has been obsessive.  Your frequent practice has greatly enhanced your powers, and your intellect has been sharpened enormously by your quest for ever better ways to channel energies.
Barbarians used to push you around on the street until you blasted one's leg off with a lightning bolt.  You reflected later on the stupidity of this, because you could by no means have blasted his friends, too.  Fortunately, they ran off.  You resolved to learn how to take out a whole group of barbarians before losing your temper again.
On the other hand, you have totally neglected to learn to use weaponry, so you're soft and weak.
Your study of magical devices allows you to notice when an object has a magical aura, and you are often able to fathom the purpose of magical devices.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,31): <br /><pre>Alchemist
Your specialty is magical devices and concoctions, but you've also had some training in weaponry, so that you could fend off townsfolk angered by the vile reeks that frequently emanate from your workshop.
Searching for the ultimate recipe and trying to recover lost knowledge has sharpened your wits considerably.
Your focus, however, has left little time for physical training, and your sedentary lifestyle has weakened you.
Your dependence on magical devices extends to the use of a talisman to channel mana.  The talisman has become attuned to detonation and transmutation because of the way you have used it.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,29): <br /><pre>Wizard
You're the generalist of the spellcasters.  You've emphasized the use of magic and studied all its areas equally.
You've learned something about the gods and religious devotion as well.
To a much lesser extent, you've studied weaponry, but you've not had much physical training:  you're mostly sedentary, and so you're not nearly so strong and healthy as you could be.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,27): <br /><pre>Summoner
You've had more of an emphasis on physical training than most spellcasters, at the expense of less practice with spellcasting.  You've never learned to use magic innately, but instead rely on a magic talisman to channel mana for you.
Your work has leaned heavily toward the art of summoning creatures to help you in a fight, and your talisman has become attuned to that.  That attunement, however, makes it harder for you to reject unwanted creatures.
You've also had a reasonable education in religious devotion.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,25): <br /><pre>Evoker
Your specialty is the use of attack spells in combat.  You practice these spells daily, and your capacity to cast them has increased hugely.
You've had some training in weaponry to help defend yourself, but you tend to leave most of the fighting to others, so your physical training has been somewhat lacking.
You've never learned to use magic innately, but instead rely on a magic talisman to channel mana for you.  The attack spells have imprinted themselves somewhat on your talisman, making it good for those and less useful for anything else.
You have not been trained in religious devotion:  however, you come from a religious family and will have no particular difficulty taking up the service of a god.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (5,23): <br /><pre>Warlock
You've divided your time between learning magic and learning weapons, but have totally disregarded religious devotion.
You're physically stronger and hardier because of your training, and you know the use of weapons and bows.  However, you're just a bit clumsy in both weaponry and magic because you've had to divide your time between them.

<li>magic_mouth (9,29): <br /><pre>Priest
As a priest, you've learned an intense devotion to your god, and you've learned how to channel the energies your god vouchsafes to his devotees.
You've been taught the use of weapons, but only cursorily, and your physical training has been lacking in general.
Since you're in tune with the holy powers, you can tell when a god has marked an object as accursed.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,27): <br /><pre>Paladin
You are a militant priest, with an emphasis on 'priest'.
You've been taught archery and the use of weapons, but great care has been taken that you're doctrinally correct.  Now you've been sent out in the world to convert the unrighteous and destroy the enemies of the faith.  Your church members have been charged a pretty penny to equip you for the job!
All other areas of your education have been neglected.  Perhaps aware of your deficiency, your superiors have given you some measure of protection from magic.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,25): <br /><pre>Monk
In the Monastery, they believed in mental discipline and peace through physical training, meditation, and, to a lesser extent, religious devotion.
Your mental equilibrium requires you to forego the use of weapons, but your physical training in karate means you're not helpless.
Your inner peace grants you the ability to regenerate faster and to sense metaphysical auras.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,23): <br /><pre>Thief
Trained to be a thief from a young age, you've learned to steal and you're familiar with the value a fence will give you on your "finds".
You've had some weaponry training, including archery; this being advisable to someone who is likely to have acrimonious disagreements about the ownership of valuable objects.
You've had no time for either religious devotion or the study of magecraft, but your quick wits have been enough to keep you alive so far.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,21): <br /><pre>Ninja
As a member of the secret society of the Ninja, you've been taught archery, the use of weapons, and also the art of combat without weapons.  Your style of combat, leans very much toward the sneak attack, so you've been taught how to be inconspicuous and to appear in places you're not expected.
You have had no introduction to either religious devotion or magic.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,19): <br /><pre>Swashbuckler
Shipboard most of your life, you've learned good balance and agility, and you've also become strong and hardy.  Because of occasional oars work, you and your shipmates have an admirable command of rhythm, and you can sing well.
You've learned to make the most of your time in port:  after passing out drunk in a bar and waking to find yourself short your pay, you've found ways to acquire new capital, or at the very least, talk someone into helping you out of your fix.
On numerous occasions, you've taken up arms and bow in defense of your ship, so you're facile with weapons, but you've had no chance to learn magic or the ways of gods.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,17): <br /><pre>Barbarian
Growing up in the howling wilderness, you've had no chance to pursue anything remotely intellectual, let alone learn your letters!  It's amazing you ever thought of leaving your hovel and going somewhere else, you're so ignorant.  But now you have.
You find that you're a lot tougher and stronger than these city folk, and you know how to get around in rough terrain.  You've learned archery in order to fill your cook pot, and weaponry is second nature to anyone who's had to fight with the local orc-tribe over food once a month.
You're deeply afraid of magic, and it'll be a while before you get over that and develop any facility with it.
You've no deep problem with the idea of gods, but you don't know much about them.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (9,15): <br /><pre>Warrior
As a Warrior you've been trained in the art of combat with weapons and in archery.
Because of your training, you're stronger, more agile, and hardier than you would be otherwise.
Your education, however, has not included studies in the magical arts or religious devotion, and, in general, lacks breadth.

<li>magic_mouth (7,15): <br /><pre>To begin choosing a character class, walk into the room ahead.  Examine the different classes by stepping on the first tile of each aisle.  When you find a class that appeals to you, walk forward onto the teleport circle for that class.  At that point, your character will often assume the appearance of the fellow standing at the end of the aisle.
Note that your character's statistics like strength, dexterity, and so on, will be automatically adjusted according the chosen class.  Keep this in mind when making a selection. Some statistics will get higher, and others will get lower.
It may be helpful to choose a class keeping in mind which statistics are high and low.  For example, it may not be wise to pick a warrior class if your character has very low strength, and electing a magical class with a very low power statistic may prevent your character from using magic until artifacts may be found that raise your characters statistics to a useful level.

<li>/pup_land/lone_town/shops/buildshop</li>
<ul><li>Removing items (21,20): <br /><pre>To remove built items, you need a 'generic destroyer.'
Simply apply it, and fire in the desired direction.  It will remove the first built item from the location.
Warning: a destroyer will remove items starting from the lowest order on the spot.  Basically, this means the first removed item will be a pedestal (underground), then items on floor.
Note that the destroyer will not remove walls or floors.
</pre></li>
<li>Building restrictions (21,19): <br /><pre>To build on a spot, all items on this spot must be 'buildable.'
Buildable items will display 'this is a buildable item' when examined.
There are several exceptions though.  In all cases you can build on marking runes as they are used for making gates and buttons work together.  Also you can build signs and talking books on of books and or scrolls, because they are needed for specifying the message.  Also, buttons, levers and pedestals can be built underneath gates.  Don't worry, you should have some clear messages on why you can't build.
</pre></li>
<li>Signs and talking books (21,18): <br /><pre>When making signs and talking (or listening) books, you need to place a book or scroll with the text you want on the square you're building on just like a marking rune.
With the talking/listening books, they will take the name and picture of the book used to create them as well.
For the talking and listening books, you also need to connect them with a marking rune just like gates buttons and levers, which in the case of the talking books, makes the book say it's message when activated, and in the case of listening books, it causes saying the phrase that the book looks for to act like pulling a lever.
For the listening books, the message must be in this format:
@match blah
Click.
Which will make it activate when somebody within two squares says "blah", and will additionally say "Click." upon activation.
</pre></li>
<li>Basic building instructions (18,21): <br /><pre>To build your own home, you can use different items:
* generic builder: this tool lets you build anything.  You need one to build.
* generic destroyer: this tool lets you destroy a built item.  This will remove any built item, except floors and white_walls.
* materials: you need those to build items.  For instance, a 'Wood floor material' enables you to build a woodfloor.
To build an item:
* apply the builder
* mark the material of the item you want to build
* fire the builder in the desired direction
Of course, the material is used when you build, so you need to buy quite a few.
</pre></li>
<li>Building floor and walls (18,20): <br /><pre>Building enables you to put walls and floors where you want.
Building a floor lets you remove walls.  This is the only way to remove them.
You can change an existing floor by building another on top.  Same goes for walls.
All created floors are magic, and will preserve items you put on them.
You can add a window in some walls.  To remove the window, build a new wall.
</pre></li>
<li>Building gates and buttons/pedestals (18,19): <br /><pre>Some items, like gates, require buttons, pedestals, ..., something to be opened and closed. To build a gate with its associated button:
* put a marking rune at the spot where you wish to build the door.  The text can be whatever you want, make sure to remember it.
* build the gate on this spot
* put a marking rune at the spot where you with to put the button. Use the same text as for the door.
* build the button
Your button will now activate the gate when you apply it.
Note that you can link together as many gates, buttons, pedestals, as you want.
As long as you use the same text on the marking rune, they will all work together.
To build gates activated by other buttons, just use another text.
Normally all gates with a single marking rune text are either all up or all down at a given time, however if you want one open while another is closed, make use of inverted gates.
Also, it is possible to make buttons, levers, and pedestals underneath gates, however it requires things to be made in a specific order.
* make 2 marking runes on the square that you want to build the button and gate on
* build the gate first
* then build the button underneath it
This is useful for making a gate avoid crushing people underneath it.  Also, you can use this same technique with inverted gates in order to make a square that pushes objects placed on it off of it.
</pre></li>
<li>Building other items (18,18): <br /><pre>All items not requiring any special handling are built simply by marking the appropriate material and firing the builder.  Note that, to avoid any issue, those items can not be picked up.  Note also that you can build an item on another.

<li>To Navar (15,12): <br /><pre>Navar is a good place for more experienced players to start. You might have to do a bit more exploring, but it is more likely that you'll find something... interesting.
-=> WARNING <=-
Navar is not a "newbie friendly" place. Novices should start either in the tutorial or Scorn. Consider yourself warned!
</pre></li>
<li>Tutorial (12,9): <br /><pre>Take this teleporter to the Beginners' House where you can learn some basic skills before journeying onward.
</pre></li>
<li>To Scorn (9,12): <br /><pre>Scorn is the best place for new players to start after they've completed the tutorial. Players starting in Scorn have a lot of options for adventuring. However, this does mean that there are probably other people adventuring in the same area.
The password to get past the gate is "eureka".
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (3,12): <br /><pre>Step into the portal to go to Scorn.

The landscape around Brest makes a return dragon flight not possible. So when travelling to the great Kingdom of Brittany, you will have to find your own way home. Either through magical means or brave the dangerous and deadly ice swept path through the mountains.
You have been warned!
Say, "Dangerous return" to open the gate to purchase your flight ticket.

<li>Updating Crossfire (17,13): <br /><pre>The development of Crossfire never stops.  Keep your server and client up-to-date so you can always enjoy the latest features and bugfixes.  For a detailed list of valid download sites, look at: http://crossfire.real-time.com/download/
</pre></li>
<li>Manual part III (17,11): <br /><pre>You can do several things by using only the mouse.  In the inventory-window, you can examine, apply and drop things by clicking the different mouse-buttons.  In the look-window you can do mostly the same, except you pick up items instead of dropping them when you click the right mouse button.  In both windows you can move the scrollbar in different ways by clicking the different mouse-button on it (but only if there are more items than can be displayed in the window).  In the graphical window, you can click at places with the left button to find out what is there, or with the right button to move in that general direction.
</pre></li>
<li>Manual part II (17,10): <br /><pre>When you have rolled your stats and chosen a profession, you can type `?' at any time to get information about the different keys.  The apply command (bound to key `a') is used for several things, like wearing, removing, wielding, unwielding, drinking, eating, etc.  If you hold down Shift while pressing `A', you will apply the object below you.  This is the only way to enter a house.  In addition to the direct commands which are bound to different keys, you can also type more complex commands by pressing the '-key first.  To get more information about these, try typing "'help".
</pre></li>
<li>Manual part I (17,9): <br /><pre>Crossfire is a multiplayer graphical arcade and adventure game made for the X-Window environment.  It has certain flavours from other games, especially Gauntlet (TM) and Nethack/Moria.  Any number of players can move around in their own window, picking up / using items and battle monsters.  The players all do battle in the same world, and can communicate with each other (even fight with each other).  The goal of the game is to survive and to have FUN.
</pre></li>
<li>History of Crossfire (17,8): <br /><pre>Frank Tore Johansen started writing Crossfire in March, 1992.  Since then, many people throughout the world have contributed source code, maps, graphics, and other forms of support.  Early versions of Crossfire looked much like early renditions of the game Gauntlet.  Since then, features like that of Nethack and Moria were adopted.  Presently development is moving in the direction of producing a more complex game similar to Ultima.  Throughout the years though, Crossfire continues to maintain it's very own distinctive style.

Since the destruction of our fair city by the lake I have come here -- to do the best that I can with what is left.  Humans, goblins and gnolls - we have put aside old hatred to build this last outpost community.  Many of us humans are favored as food by the cyclops, too many of us have lost our lives to the cooking pot.  I am the last human, and if I leave no children from my loins, then I consider the goblins and gnolls whom I have taught human skills my legacy.  Let those foolish immortals judge lesser men! I am a man now without religion.  Shame on those who worship such fickle beings! And a pardon on the three who have dared defy them!

<ul><li>sign (15,13): <br /><pre>This door opens only when you say
-------
shazam
-------
</pre></li>
<li>sign (15,9): <br /><pre>There are many different types of doors.
The most basic type is a simple closed door.  You can open this kind of door with a generic key like the one beside this sign.
If you have no keys you can try to break the door down by attacking it.
If you have the lockpicking skill you can try to open the door by typing 'ready_skill lockpicking' and then 'firing' (usually pressing shift + <direction>) towards the door like you would fire an arrow or a bolt.
There are also locked doors which can only be opened with special keys...
</pre></li>
<li>sign (15,4): <br /><pre>Keys can also be used to open locked chests, but not all chests are locked. Beware, though, as some doors and chests are trapped. Use caution.
The chest is locked by chance, but the key to open it is right there.
</pre></li>
<li>sign (14,13): <br /><pre>This door opens when you walk near it.
</pre></li>
<li>magic_mouth (13,26): <br /><pre>Say 'hello world' if you want the door to open.
</pre></li>
<li>sign (12,13): <br /><pre>Apply one of those 2 levers to open one door.
</pre></li>
<li>Food (11,21): <br /><pre>Remember, you need to eat or you'll starve. Never forget to carry food with you. If you have food and your food level reaches zero, your character will randomly eat some of it.
Would you like some more food now? If so, go near the altar and say 'food'.
</pre></li>
<li>Books (11,18): <br /><pre>You will find a lot of books in the Crossfire world.
Some are so difficult your character may not understand them.
Not everyone finds all books interesting, but one important fact is: Reading them often yields experience.
Simply apply a book to read it.
Reading is important for two reasons:
- learning high-level spells requires a high literacy level, gained by reading a lot
- texts contain various information about the world, including places that may be interesting to visit
</pre></li>
<li>Using Items (11,12): <br /><pre>-------------------
Tutorial: Using items
To use items in Crossfire, there are two basic methods.
The first is to use mouse buttons on your inventory.
The second is to use the command
-----
apply
-----
which uses the top object on the ground where you are standing.
Of course it isn't easy to type the command each time you want to use a lever or eat some food.  I recommend you bind the command to a key.
If you don't know how to do bind commands to keys, follow the binding tutorial by talking to Manu, the crazy key binder.  He is to your left.
-------------------

<li>Doors and Keys (11,10): <br /><pre>Doors and Keys
</pre></li>
<li>Ranged Weapons (10,16): <br /><pre>If you have a ranged weapon this would be a good chance to practice firing it at the ants.
First you ready the weapon, then hold down the fire key and press a direction key to fire a missile.
Fire is usually bound to the <shift> key by now you must know what direction keys are to have gotten as far as this sign.
Make sure to keep enough ammo on hand!
</pre></li>
<li>sign (9,5): <br /><pre>Welcome to Crossfire!
If you are new to this game, this map was made for you! Here you will find information on how to play.
Want a quick start? Speak to Sigmund at the entrance. Don't remember how to speak? Just type:
-------
say hello
-------
in the command box of your client or use the chat boxes if (there are any).
You will find many signs like this one in the game.
Never forget to read them as they give you useful information.
</pre></li>
<li>sign (7,18): <br /><pre>-------------------
Tutorial: Traps
Searching for traps can save your life in Crossfire.
Some traps are difficult to find, others are easy.
Some traps are dangerous, others are harmless.
To find a trap, use your trap finding skills by typing
------
use_skill find traps
------
but it is a lot easier to use the default "s" keybinding to find traps.
Some traps are hard to find, so you might want to search a number of times.
If you find a trap, disarm them so you can continue your way fully secure.
To disarm a trap, use the command
------
use_skill disarm traps
------
If at first you do not succeed, try, try again.
The "d" key is bound to the disarm command by default.
It is really useful to use keybindings for these actions since they are used a lot.
Now follow the black marbled path and try to find and disarm all the traps.
Are you confused yet?

</pre></li>
<li>Food (2,13): <br /><pre>Food is important for you to stay alive. Apply it to eat it. If your food bar runs down, you will begin to rapidly lose HP. Regenerating HP and mana also requires food, so remember to bring plenty to battles!

Gave of his time.
Gave of his meager wage.
Gave of his magic.
Such a gentle being was he.
Raised his hand against nothing.
Raised his voice against nothing
Raised his magic against none.
Such a wise being was he.
To all whom asked wisdom spoken.
To all whom strived magic dispensed.
To all whom needed guidance given.
Such a murdered being is he taken to darkness in sleep never to wake.
Murdered cowardly in the slumber.
A roll of the dice and the fool taketh his life, and his corpse.
To the alter his physical being strives.
To the alter where the physical must to dust turn so the spirit may be free.

<li>magic_mouth (8,8): <br /><pre>There was a wizard.  He had an apprentice.  What is said are lies.  There are no good wizards.  No good apprentice of magic ever existed.

Niome, my lovely wife is eager to look for relics or ruins to prove or disprove the existence of ancient Arranore, but for me it will be enough to study the gentle Arranorian apes.

<li>Notes on Ruggilli (6,10): <br /><pre>To Whom it may concern,
Ruggilli is the true God of destruction.  His power is the strength behind the mighty red dragons.  You too can share this power, but at a cost.  If you proceed with Ruggilli you will liken yourself to Him.  Ruggilli has an immense appetite, you will find yourself eating more than is normal, carry a little extra food and you need not worry, but woe if you run out.  As a follower of Ruggilli, his protections and vulnerabilities are also shared.  You will become more resistant to fire but less to cold, also your very skin will protect you from any physical projectile.  This will compensate for your inability to wear armour as Ruggilli deems such items lowly.  Ruggilli is a god of chaos, you must use this to your advantage.  A quick attack is your main strength as Ruggilli will immolate all your enemies.  Be warned though, creatures immune to fire shall not be harmed by Ruggilli's will.  If you prove yourself worthy your strength shall again be boosted with the aura of Ruggilli.  By summoning this enemies of Ruggilli will quickly perish. Keep in mind though, both your strengths and weaknesses and you will surely thrive.

<li>/scorn/shops/buildshop</li>
<ul><li>Basic building instructions (13,19): <br /><pre>To build your own home, you can use different items:
* generic builder: this tool lets you build anything.  You need one to build.
* generic destroyer: this tool lets you destroy a built item.  This will remove any built item, except floors and walls.
* materials: you need those to build items.  For instance, a 'Wood floor material' enables you to build a woodfloor.
To build an item:
* apply the builder
* mark the material of the item you want to build
* fire the builder in the desired direction
Of course, the material is used when you build, so you need to buy quite a few.
</pre></li>
<li>Building floor and walls (13,18): <br /><pre>Building enables you to put walls and floors where you want.
Building a floor lets you remove walls.  This is the only way to remove them.
You can change an existing floor by building another on top.  Same goes for walls.
All created floors are magic, and will preserve items you put on them.
You can add a window in some walls.  To remove the window, build a new wall.
</pre></li>
<li>Building gates and buttons/pedestals (13,17): <br /><pre>Some items, like gates, require buttons, pedestals, ..., something to be opened and closed.
To build a gate with its associated button:
* put a marking rune at the spot where you wish to build the door.  The text can be whatever you want, make sure to remember it.
* build the gate on this spot
* put a marking rune at the spot where you with to put the button.  Use the same text as for the door.
* build the button
Your button will now activate the gate when you apply it.
Note that you can link together as many gates, buttons, pedestals, as you want.
As long as you use the same text on the marking rune, they will all work together.
To build gates activated by other buttons, just use another text.
Normally all gates with a single marking rune text are either all up or all down at a given time, however if you want one open while another is closed, make use of inverted gates.
Also, it is possible to make buttons, levers, and pedestals underneath gates, however it requires things to be made in a specific order.
* make 2 marking runes on the square that you want to build the button and gate on
* build the gate first
* then build the button underneath it
This is useful for making a gate avoid crushing people underneath it.  Also, you can use this same technique with inverted gates in order to make a square that pushes objects placed on it off of it.
</pre></li>
<li>Building other items (13,16): <br /><pre>All items not requiring any special handling are built simply by marking the appropriate material and firing the builder.
Note that, to avoid any issue, those items can not be picked up.
Note also that you can build an item on another.
</pre></li>
<li>Removing items (13,15): <br /><pre>To remove built items, you need a 'generic destroyer'.
Simply apply it, and fire in the desired direction.  It will remove the first built item from the location.
Warning: a destroyer will remove items starting from the lowest order on the spot.  Basically, this means the first removed item will be a pedestal (underground), then items on floor.
Note that the destroyer will not remove walls or floors.
</pre></li>
<li>Building restrictions (13,14): <br /><pre>To build on a spot, all items on this spot must be 'buildable'.
Buildable items will display 'this is a buildable item' when examined.
There are several exceptions though.  In all cases you can build on marking runes as they are used for making gates and buttons work together.  Also you can build signs and talking books on of books and or scrolls, because they are needed for specifying the message.  Also, buttons, levers and pedestals can be built underneath gates.  Don't worry, you should have some clear messages on why you can't build.
</pre></li>
<li>Signs and talking books (13,13): <br /><pre>When making signs and talking (or listening) books, you need to place a book or scroll with the text you want on the square you're building on just like a marking rune.
With the talking/listening books, they will take the name and picture of the book used to create them as well.
For the talking and listening books, you also need to connect them with a marking rune just like gates buttons and levers, which in the case of the talking books, makes the book say it's message when activated, and in the case of listening books, it causes saying the phrase that the book looks for to act like pulling a lever.
For the listening books, the message must be in this format:
@match blah
Click.
Which will make it activate when somebody within two squares says "blah", and will additionally say "Click." upon activation.

<ul><li>Darcap-Navar Relations, by Poltihr (17,17): <br /><pre>The closest to Darcap, it was only logical Navar would help build a road joining its northern neighbourg around 6150 EK.
But Navar leaders were reluctant to trust the hordes of undead living in the town, so, according to Fuldar's research, they ensured the road joining the towns went through a narrow tunnel can could be destroyed easily, to sever the ties with Darcap if the need ever arised.
The tension between the towns was exacerbated when, in 6170 EK, the outpost of Navar south of Zaah's castle was assaulted by undead. It took many negotiations (and some say money was exchanged too, though no one could bring a formal proof) for the Navar forces to not retaliate.
</pre></li>
<li>Short History of Darcap, by Alvanes (17,16): <br /><pre>Darcap was founded around 2265 EK, by the Kingdom of the Masts (on which few information is known). The colony was left isolated after the disappearance of this kingdom, and suffered for millenia afterwards.
During this period many inhabitants converted to Devourers to survive.
It is only in 6138 EK that the first stranger, Herghist Appelnisht, a famous explorer, set foot in the town. During his 2 years stay, he learnt the history and customs of Darcap and taught the whereabouts of the rest of the world to the inhabitants.
Navar then helped build a road connecting the two towns (some wonder why it goes through a narrow tunnel), and sponsored a shrine of Gaea.
To forget their awful past, and attract many visitors to not be forgotten again, Darcapians decided to build the biggest circus in the world, and a big port conducting business with the rest of the continent.
</pre></li>
<li>Julio the Great, by Simpoe (17,15): <br /><pre>Not much is known of Julio's life before he came to Darcap. Some rumors say he was a great wizard knowing all about Elementals, working for kings or rich merchants, doing strange work for them.
His arrival in Darcap, in 6796 EK according to most sources though some like Ubnief say it is some years before or later, was pretty unnoticed at the time.
He purchased four houses in the center of the town (for quite a large sum it is argued), and started living there full time a few years after initially coming.
Quite shortly after that, though (the consensual date is 6798 EK), strange events started to occur in his rooms. Witnesses told of weird sounds, eruptions of flame or cold wind, and other disagreements.
A few years later, neighbours officially complained to the authorities for various explosions and destructions in their houses surrounding Julio's owns.
Quite isolated, with no friend known at the time, Julio lived alone, and died around 6804 EK.
It is only in 6813 EK that the sultan Marshi IV, having respected the dead wizard's wish to wait some years, published evidence showing Julio was a major element in the town's prosperity.
For years, and even before his arrival in the town proper, he had advised the sultan and his aids on the affairs of the world, favored the expansion of commerce to and from Darcap, and used his obviously great influence to enhance Darcap's circus (a full research can be found in Tilmuo's story).
As many inhabitants, including neighbours who did complain, started to tell how Julio did help them, solving many conflicts even as he was criticised, it was decided by popular consensus to make a statue of him out of gratitude.
His houses, escaping planned destruction, were restored, and became a museum to his work.

</pre></li>
<li>Notes on Ruggilli (3,10): <br /><pre>To Whom it may concern,
Ruggilli is the true God of destruction.  His power is the strength behind the mighty red dragons.  You too can share this power, but at a cost.  If you proceed with Ruggilli you will liken yourself to Him.  Ruggilli has an immense appetite, you will find yourself eating more than is normal, carry a little extra food and you need not worry, but woe if you run out.  As a follower of Ruggilli, his protections and vulnerabilities are also shared.  You will become more resistant to fire but less to cold, also your very skin will protect you from any physical projectile.  This will compensate for your inability to wear armour as Ruggilli deems such items lowly.  Ruggilli is a god of chaos, you must use this to your advantage.  A quick attack is your main strength as Ruggilli will immolate all your enemies.  Be warned though, creatures immune to fire shall not be harmed by Ruggilli's will.  If you prove yourself worthy your strength shall again be boosted with the aura of Ruggilli.  By summoning this enemies of Ruggilli will quickly perish.  Keep in mind though, both your strengths and weaknesses and you will surely thrive.

<ul><li>book (8,17): <br /><pre>Once there stood upon the desert, a city called Narcopin, ruled by a dynasty of kings, wise and powerful. In time the monarchs grew less wise but more powerful. The last of their line was Aljwaf the terrible.  His reign was bloody and he made enemies of all the neighbouring lands. His troops put women and children to the sword, he consorted with evil forces. It is said he cared for nothing save a single concubine. He fashioned a necklace for her made of one ruby, two emeralds and three sapphires. His reign ended when he was stricken with an unknown wasting disease and died horribly after a long illness. Some said the illness came from his evil dealings, they were quickly impaled for treason. Narcopin was razed to the ground by the surrounding kingdoms within six months of his death.

It's best to turn the box upside down and just shake it to let them out, and also prepare to be very charming.
As it is sometimes difficult to tame these magical pets, I have had my wife, who is a wizard, prepare a special pentagram.  Open your pet box above the pentagram and the pets you purchase here will be automatically charmed for you.  Opening them elsewhere may have unpredictable results.
All sales are final.

<ul><li>Basic building instructions (9,11): <br /><pre>To build your own home, you can use different items:
* generic builder: this tool lets you build anything. You need one to build.
* generic destroyer: this tool lets you destroy a built item. This will remove any built item, except floors and walls.
* materials: you need those to build items. For instance, a 'Wood floor material' enables you to build a woodfloor.
To build an item:
* apply the builder
* mark the material of the item you want to build
* fire the builder in the desired direction
Of course, the material is used when you build, so you need to buy quite a few.
</pre></li>
<li>Building other items (9,10): <br /><pre>All items not requiring any special handling are built simply by marking the appropriate material and firing the builder.
Note that, to avoid any issue, those items can not be picked up.
Note also that you can build an item on another.
</pre></li>
<li>Building restrictions (9,9): <br /><pre>To build on a spot, all items on this spot must be 'buildable'.
Buildable items will display 'this is a buildable item' when examined.
There are several exceptions though. In all cases you can build on marking runes as they are used for making gates and buttons work together. Also you can build signs and talking books on of books and or scrolls, because they are needed for specifying the message. Also, buttons, levers and pedestals can be built underneath gates. Don't worry, you should have some clear messages on why you can't build.
</pre></li>
<li>Signs and talking books (9,8): <br /><pre>When making signs and talking (or listening) books, you need to place a book or scroll with the text you want on the square you're building on just like a marking rune.
With the talking/listening books, they will take the name and picture of the book used to create them as well.
For the talking and listening books, you also need to connect them with a marking rune just like gates buttons and levers, which in the case of the talking books, makes the book say it's message when activated, and in the case of listening books, it causes saying the phrase that the book looks for to act like pulling a lever.
For the listening books, the message must be in this format:
@match blah
Click.
Which will make it activate when somebody within two squares says "blah", and will additionally say "Click." upon activation.
</pre></li>
<li>sign (7,12): <br /><pre>Welcome to Acme. Inc construction shop!
You will find here everything you need to build your own customized home, sweet home.
Make sure to read our documentation on how to build nice maps.
</pre></li>
<li>Removing items (7,11): <br /><pre>To remove built items, you need a 'generic destroyer'.
Simply apply it, and fire in the desired direction. It will remove the first built item from the location.
Warning: a destroyer will remove items starting from the lowest order on the spot. Basically, this means the first removed item will be a pedestal (underground), then items on floor.
Note that the destroyer will not remove walls or floors.
</pre></li>
<li>Building gates and buttons/pedestals (7,10): <br /><pre>Some items, like gates, require buttons, pedestals, ..., something to be opened and closed.
To build a gate with its associated button:
* put a marking rune at the spot where you wish to build the door. The text can be whatever you want, make sure to remember it.
* build the gate on this spot
* put a marking rune at the spot where you with to put the button. Use the same text as for the door.
* build the button
Your button will now activate the gate when you apply it.
Note that you can link together as many gates, buttons, pedestals, as you want.
As long as you use the same text on the marking rune, they will all work together.
To build gates activated by other buttons, just use another text.
Normally all gates with a single marking rune text are either all up or all down at a given time, however if you want one open while another is closed, make use of inverted gates.
Also, it is possible to make buttons, levers, and pedestals underneath gates, however it requires things to be made in a specific order.
* make 2 marking runes on the square that you want to build the button and gate on
* build the gate first
* then build the button underneath it
This is useful for making a gate avoid crushing people underneath it. Also, you can use this same technique with inverted gates in order to make a square that pushes objects placed on it off of it.
</pre></li>
<li>Building floor and walls (7,9): <br /><pre>Building enables you to put walls and floors where you want.
Building a floor lets you remove walls. This is the only way to remove them.
You can change an existing floor by building another on top. Same goes for walls.
All created floors are magic, and will preserve items you put on them.
You can add a window in some walls. To remove the window, build a new wall.

<li>magic_mouth (16,6): <br /><pre>Darcap history
</pre></li>
<li>Darcap's summed up history, by Alvanes (15,5): <br /><pre>Darcap was founded around 2265 EK, by the Kingdom of the Masts (on which few information is known). The colony was left isolated after the disappearance of this kingdom, and suffered for millenia afterwards.
During this period many inhabitants converted to Devourers to survive.
It is only in 6138 EK that the first stranger, Herghist Appelnisht, a famous explorer, set foot in the town. During his 2 years stay, he learnt the history and customs of Darcap and taught the whereabouts of the rest of the world to the inhabitants.
Navar then helped build a road connecting the two towns (some wonder why it goes through a narrow tunnel), and sponsored a shrine of Gaea.
To forget their awful past, and attract many visitors to not be forgotten again, Darcapians decided to build the biggest circus in the world, and a big port conducting business with the rest of the continent.
</pre></li>
<li>Darcap and Navar relations, by Poltihr (12,8): <br /><pre>The closest to Darcap, it was only logical Navar would help build a road joining its northern neighbourg around 6150 EK.
But Navar leaders were reluctant to trust the hordes of undead living in the town, so, according to Fuldar's research, they ensured the road joining the towns went through a narrow tunnel can could be destroyed easily, to sever the ties with Darcap if the need ever arised.
The tension between the towns was exacerbated when, in 6170 EK, the outpost of Navar south of Zaah's castle was assaulted by undead. It took many negotiations (and some say money was exchanged too, though no one could bring a formal proof) for the Navar forces to not retaliate.
</pre></li>
<li>Julio the Great, by Simpoe (12,5): <br /><pre>Not much is known of Julio's life before he came to Darcap. Some rumors say he was a great wizard knowing all about Elementals, working for kings or rich merchants, doing strange work for them.
His arrival in Darcap, in 6796 EK according to most sources though some like Ubnief say it is some years before or later, was pretty unnoticed at the time.
He purchased four houses in the center of the town (for quite a large sum it is argued), and started living there full time a few years after initially coming.
Quite shortly after that, though (the consensual date is 6798 EK), strange events started to occur in his rooms. Witnesses told of weird sounds, eruptions of flame or cold wind, and other disagreements.
A few years later, neighbours officially complained to the authorities for various explosions and destructions in their houses surrounding Julio's owns.
Quite isolated, with no friend known at the time, Julio lived alone, and died around 6804 EK.
It is only in 6813 EK that the sultan Marshi IV, having respected the dead wizard's wish to wait some years, published evidence showing Julio was a major element in the town's prosperity.
For years, and even before his arrival in the town proper, he had advised the sultan and his aids on the affairs of the world, favored the expansion of commerce to and from Darcap, and used his obviously great influence to enhance Darcap's circus (a full research can be found in Tilmuo's story).
As many inhabitants, including neighbours who did complain, started to tell how Julio did help them, solving many conflicts even as he was criticised, it was decided by popular consensus to make a statue of him out of gratitude.
His houses, escaping planned destruction, were restored, and became a museum to his work.

<ul><li>tome (37,11): <br /><pre>Spell Point regeneration rate controls how fast one's Spell Points are replenished.  Some races, such as elves, have an innately fast spell point regeneration.  Spell-casting classes also regenerate Spell Points at a faster rate.  Besides this, the equipment one uses may also affect spell point regeneration rate:
o  Some magical rings or amulets are resonant to the patterns of the aether, and cause Spell Points to flow into the wearer faster.  These items show a (magic+N) when identified.
o  Although some armour specially crafted for mages may increase spell point regeneration, in general most heavy armour will impede the flow of Spell Points into the wearer and slow down Spell Point regeneration rates.
o  Special weapons crafted for mages may also have Spell Point regeneration bonuses.
</pre></li>
<li>exposition (37,10): <br /><pre>There are two factors controlling one's magical powers: Spell Point capacity, and Spell Point regeneration rate.  Spell Points is the force that drives magical spells; Spell Point capacity is how much Spell Points one can naturally have.  Spell Point regeneration rate is how fast the Spell Points are replenished.  Spell Point capacity is controlled mainly by one's power (Pow) and level of magic experience.  One's intelligence (Int) also affects this capacity, to a lesser degree.  Some magical equipment grant Pow bonuses, which will increase this capacity while worn.  Improvement potions may also permanently increase one's Spell Point capacity.  There are also very rare gemstones that have capacity to store Spell Points.  Spell Points stored in these crystals can be retrieved at a single touch.  High-level wizards use these stones to increase the total amount of Spell Points they have at their disposal.
</pre></li>
<li>sign (35,11): <br /><pre>The Glowing Crystal exhibited here is one of the rare gemstones that are able to store Spell Points.  Touching it when your Spell Points is at maximum capacity will transfer half your Spell Points into it.  Touching it when you are below maximum capacity will retrieve any stored Spell Points, up to your capacity.  This particular crystal can only store up to 200 Spell Points.  Crystals with capacities for 1000 Spell Points and beyond are known to exist; and are very much sought after by all spellcasters.

<ul><li>How to Restore Drained Abilities (12,26): <br /><pre>Drained abilities (stats), lost by fighting undead, or dying, may be restored via drinking a "potion of life."  The ones who are experienced in the skill of priesthood, they can pray over an altar and eventually get restored by their deity.  However, this does not work for all cults.

restoration
The healing potion is equivalent to the heal spell. The Restoration spell does NOT restore depleted stats.
</pre></li>
<li>On the Cure of Disease (10,26): <br /><pre>You find a lengthy treatise on disease and its cure.  Some diseases, apparently, are more difficult to cure than others, and require a higher level of skill.  Other diseases can be expected to run their course and go away without causing serious harm, unless of course, one is in a situation in which temporary incapacity is fatal.  The cure disease spell is effective against disease, except as remarked above.  Restoration also works well against disease.  Cure wounds spells won't cure disease, but they will reduce symptoms.  Cure wounds spells therefore can be used to keep a person alive until the disease may be cured.  Also, they may keep him alive until the disease naturally goes away.  There are also claims of herbal, alchemical, animal, or other magical cures for disease, but these belong in another treatise.

</pre></li>
<li>hint from the semi-gods 3 (11,8): <br /><pre>Guide to weapon-enchanting:
- mark (and wield) a non-magical weapon
- drop a bunch of diamonds, then apply a "scroll of Prepare Weapon"
- apply a "scroll of Improve <Stat>"
- drop the type and amount of potions you are prompted for, then apply the scroll again
</pre></li>
<li>hint from the semi-gods 8 (10,10): <br /><pre>Be careful when collecting food in dungeons.  Poisoned food can kill players of low level very quick! Check if the food stacks with the pieces you're already carrying.
</pre></li>
<li>hint from the semi-gods 5 (10,9): <br /><pre>Raising your Stats (Str/Dex/Con/...) by drinking potions of Strength/Dexterity/..etc is the best way to level up quickly.  Those cannot be found in shops.  Hence, in the beginning, you should try to find places (in dungeons) where to obtain random potions.
</pre></li>
<li>hint from the semi-gods 2 (10,8): <br /><pre>When you die - and that will happen - you loose some experience and one Stat (like Str -1 or Wis -1).  The exp. is gone, but the Stats can be recovered by drinking a potion of life! For skilled priests there is yet an easier way: Pray over an altar of your deity... The gods won't ignore the bidding of a worthy disciple.
</pre></li>
<li>hint from the semi-gods 7 (9,10): <br /><pre>Using potions is very important.
potion of fire resistance:
	90 resist to fire
potion of cold resistance:
	90 resist to cold
potion of shielding:
	90 resist to physical
</pre></li>
<li>hint from the semi-gods 4 (9,9): <br /><pre>You can get lots of useful information by examining all kinds of objects in your surrounding.  For example:

<li>sign (1,5): <br /><pre>Good day, traveller!
The landscape around Brest makes a return dragon flight not possible. So when travelling to the great Kingdom of Brittany, you will have to find your own way home. Either through magical means or brave the dangerous and deadly ice swept path through the mountains.
You have been warned!
Say, "Dangerous return" to open the gate to purchase your flight ticket.

<ul><li>Cures for Miscellaneous Problems (12,27): <br /><pre>Poison may be cured via the "cure poison" prayer.  Madness or confusion may be cured via the "cure confusion" prayer.  Blindness may be cured via the "cure blindness" prayer.  The "restoration" spell cures all hazards mentioned above.  Note that these spells are also available on scrolls.
</pre></li>
<li>How to Restore Drained Abilities (12,26): <br /><pre>Drained abilities (stats), lost by fighting undead, or dying, may be restored via drinking a "potion of life."  The ones who are experienced in the skill of priesthood, they can pray over an altar and eventually get restored by their deity.  However, this does not work for all cults.

<li>On the Healing of Wounds (10,27): <br /><pre>Many spells are effective for speeding the recovery of a wounded person.  Some potions are also efficacious.  In increasing order of effectiveness:
minor healing
medium healing
major healing
heal
restoration
The healing potion is equivalent to the heal spell. The Restoration spell does NOT restore depleted stats.
</pre></li>
<li>On the Cure of Disease (10,26): <br /><pre>You find a lengthy treatise on disease and its cure.  Some diseases, apparently, are more difficult to cure than others, and require a higher level of skill.  Other diseases can be expected to run their course and go away without causing serious harm, unless of course, one is in a situation in which temporary incapacity is fatal.  The cure disease spell is effective against disease, except as remarked above.  Restoration also works well against disease.  Cure wounds spells won't cure disease, but they will reduce symptoms.  Cure wounds spells therefore can be used to keep a person alive until the disease may be cured.  Also, they may keep him alive until the disease naturally goes away.  There are also claims of herbal, alchemical, animal, or other magical cures for disease, but these belong in another treatise.

<li>The Imperial Tribune: EXTRA EDITION (4,36): <br /><pre>HEADLINE: EXPLOSION ROCKS TAVERN
A bomber detonated a high powered explosive device in the popular Goth's Tavern in Scorn.  The blast killed two and injured 5.  The bomber is reported to have screamed "Die booze ridden devil worshipers! Viva Valriel!" before throwing the bomb and then fleeing on foot.  He is believed to have be a popular priest at the 'Traveling Ministry Of The Most Holy Power.'
CRIME ON THE RISE:
The Ministry of Peace has released a report saying that crime in Scorn is skyrocketing.  The Ministry blames "piracy."  The Guild of Showmen supports the study.
CHURCH OF VALRIEL TIES TO VIOLENCE:
An undercover investigation into the 'Holy Church of Valriel' has discovered monetary ties to a militant group operating under the 'Traveling Ministry Of The Most Holy Power.'  When asked about this situation the High Priest of Valriel said, "Ask God."
THREE KILLED IN POISON GAS ATTACK:
Three women were killed when trying to enter a tavern near the western wall of Navar.  Before they could give the password for entry into the tavern a figure unleashed a nerve agent into the air killing the women.  It is believed this was an attack by a right wing religious organization who worship Valriel.
CHILD STABS SELF - KNIVES BANNED
A child killed himself by stabbing himself.  All knives over one foot are now banned by order of the high court of Navar, swords are unaffected.
SCORN NOW LARGEST WESTERN CITY
The census of last year has now confirmed that Scorn is now the largest western city by population.  Taxes are expected to rise, Navar unaffected.
WAR IMMINENT?
Talk of war against the dragons is circulating around Scorn.  Since the Dragon Emissary started demanding tribute tensions have worsened.  The question now seems to be how big an army must be raised?

<li>The Imperial Tribune (45,10): <br /><pre>HEADLINE: EXPLOSION ROCKS TAVERN
A bomber detonated a high powered explosive device in the popular Goth's Tavern in Scorn.  The blast killed two and injured 5.  The bomber is reported to have screamed "Die booze ridden devil worshipers! Viva Valriel!" before throwing the bomb and then fleeing on foot.  He is believed to have be a popular priest at the 'Traveling Ministry Of The Most Holy Power.'
CRIME ON THE RISE:
The Ministry of Peace has released a report saying that crime in Scorn is skyrocketing.  The Ministry blames "piracy."  The Guild of Showmen supports the study.
CHURCH OF VALRIEL TIES TO VIOLENCE:
An undercover investigation into the 'Holy Church of Valriel' has discovered monetary ties to a militant group operating under the 'Traveling Ministry Of The Most Holy Power.' When asked about this situation the High Priest of Valriel said, "Ask God."
THREE KILLED IN POISON GAS ATTACK:
Three women were killed when trying to enter a tavern near the western wall of Navar.  Before they could give the password for entry into the tavern a figure unleashed a nerve agent into the air killing the women.  It is believed this was an attack by a right wing religious organization who worship Valriel.
CHILD STABS SELF - KNIVES BANNED
A child killed himself by stabbing himself.  All knives over one foot are now banned by order of the high court of Navar, swords are unaffected.

Gothwolte fell in that very deep hole and it was quickly filled up by the mage.  Gothwolte was immortal - but his body, the warrior was not.  The warrior died of starvation and his flesh decayed.  Gothwolte, without a body to control, couldn't move again...

<li>research 4 (11,1): <br /><pre> As he grew stronger, Gothwolte learned to command the fighter through the sword.  While under control of Gothwolte, the fighter continued to search for immunity scrolls, because improving the sword meant improving Gothwolte himself.  His powers increased with every scroll and one day he finally was immune to everything - Gothwolte was invulnerable.

<li>research 3 (10,1): <br /><pre> There were many powerful improvement scrolls available in the ancient world.  Weapon protection to fire, cold, ..., Weapon immunity to physical, electricity, ... and many more.  The fighter improved the sword by using many of these scrolls.  The weapon enchantments also had an affect on Gothwolte.  He also he gained protections and immunities.  He started to recover and heal.
</pre></li>
<li>research 2 (9,1): <br /><pre> One day, Gothwolte was drawn to the power of an ancient dancing sword.  His lust for power caused him to seek spirtual posession of the sword.   But the magical sword was different from controlling a living being.  Gothwolte was badly injured during the process.  He was also trapped in the sword, unable to move.  By chance, a strong warrior came along just then.  He picked up the sword and wielded it.
</pre></li>
<li>research 1 (8,1): <br /><pre> Gothwolte is some kind of ancient ghost.  It's origin is unknown.  It has a special skill, it can possess the living.

<li>silver studded book (5,14): <br /><pre>Wist(alias Twis) is one of the greatest wizard in the realm.  Before he was imprisoned in the fortress he lived in his tower to the northeast and use the cave near the mountain to do research.  The tower is deserted and is occupied by some unknown hosts.  Some powerful wizards went and never returned.  The tower has such defense that it's almost impossible to access it.  As for the cave, it is believed that there is still a teleporter to go to the tower.  And it was from the cave that our lord went to seize the wizard to stop his mad deeds.  The teleporter should be activated by the name of someone, if I remembered correctly.  Kashu was one of the people that the wizard respects. Maybe ...

<ul><li>Removing items (16,39): <br /><pre>To remove built items, you need a 'generic destroyer'.
Simply apply it, and fire in the desired direction.  It will remove the first built item from the location.
Warning: a destroyer will remove items starting from the lowest order on the spot.  Basically, this means the first removed item will be a pedestal (underground), then items on floor.
Note that the destroyer will not remove walls or floors.
</pre></li>
<li>Building restrictions (16,38): <br /><pre>To build on a spot, all items on this spot must be 'buildable'.
Buildable items will display 'this is a buildable item' when examined.
There are several exceptions though.  In all cases you can build on marking runes as they are used for making gates and buttons work together.  Also you can build signs and talking books on of books and or scrolls, because they are needed for specifying the message.  Also, buttons, levers and pedestals can be built underneath gates.  Don't worry, you should have some clear messages on why you can't build.
</pre></li>
<li>Signs and talking books (16,37): <br /><pre>When making signs and talking (or listening) books, you need to place a book or scroll with the text you want on the square you're building on just like a marking rune.
With the talking/listening books, they will take the name and picture of the book used to create them as well.
For the talking and listening books, you also need to connect them with a marking rune just like gates buttons and levers, which in the case of the talking books, makes the book say it's message when activated, and in the case of listening books, it causes saying the phrase that the book looks for to act like pulling a lever.
For the listening books, the message must be in this format:
@match blah
Click.
Which will make it activate when somebody within two squares says "blah", and will additionally say "Click." upon activation
</pre></li>
<li>Basic building instructions (13,40): <br /><pre>To build your own home, you can use different items:
* generic builder: this tool lets you build anything.  You need one to build.
* generic destroyer: this tool lets you destroy a built item.  This will remove any built item, except floors and walls.
* materials: you need those to build items.  For instance, a 'Wood floor material' enables you to build a woodfloor.
To build an item:
* apply the builder
* mark the material of the item you want to build
* fire the builder in the desired direction
Of course, the material is used when you build, so you need to buy quite a few.
</pre></li>
<li>Building floor and walls (13,39): <br /><pre>Building enables you to put walls and floors where you want.
Building a floor lets you remove walls.  This is the only way to remove them.
You can change an existing floor by building another on top.  Same goes for walls.
All created floors are magic, and will preserve items you put on them.
You can add a window in some walls.  To remove the window, build a new wall.
</pre></li>
<li>Building gates and buttons/pedestals (13,38): <br /><pre>Some items, like gates, require buttons, pedestals, ..., something to be opened and closed.
To build a gate with its associated button:
* put a marking rune at the spot where you wish to build the door.  The text can be whatever you want, make sure to remember it.
* build the gate on this spot
* put a marking rune at the spot where you with to put the button.  Use the same text as for the door.
* build the button
Your button will now activate the gate when you apply it.
Note that you can link together as many gates, buttons, pedestals, as you want.
As long as you use the same text on the marking rune, they will all work together.
To build gates activated by other buttons, just use another text.
Normally all gates with a single marking rune text are either all up or all down at a given time, however if you want one open while another is closed, make use of inverted gates.
Also, it is possible to make buttons, levers, and pedestals underneath gates, however it requires things to be made in a specific order.
* make 2 marking runes on the square that you want to build the button and gate on
* build the gate first
* then build the button underneath it
This is useful for making a gate avoid crushing people underneath it.  Also, you can use this same technique with inverted gates in order to make a square that pushes objects placed on it off of it.
</pre></li>
<li>Building other items (13,37): <br /><pre>All items not requiring any special handling are built simply by marking the appropriate material and firing the builder.
Note that, to avoid any issue, those items can not be picked up.
Note also that you can build an item on another.

But that has ended and a most terrible crime has been committed.  The bricks cry, their essence attack.

<ul><li>Instructions (16,21): <br /><pre>Welcome to Shougyoukumiai Sumai Inc. where you can purchase your very own Shougyoukumiai Sumai.
Three characters are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 30,000 diamonds for the altars.
After the fee has been paid, two characters must stand on the pedestals in the small southern rooms, while the third picks up the keys from the rooms above the altars.
If there are no keys available, we're very sorry, but it means we've run out of available guild houses.  Perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

<li>magic_mouth (9,1): <br /><pre>Welcome to Nethack in Crossfire.  Nethack in Crossfire is a tribute to the venerable game Nethack, which inspired many of the things you will find in Crossfire.  The resemblance of these random maps to the true game, Nethack, is more in spirit than in detail.  Beware! In these series of maps, you'll find many customized monsters in the nethack style, that will have little in common with monsters which may look like it in the broader Crossfire game.  In particular, more monsters attack with acid, and the undead often have madness and paralysis in their touch, as in Nethack.  You will not be able to leave Nethack in Crossfire without the Amulet of Yendor, or dungeon master intervention.  To play Nethack in Crossfire, step onto the teleporter and say "Understood."
