<p><b>Region's longname:</b> Hamlet of Lord Marksel</p>
<p><b>Region description:</b> Situated about half way between The Kingdom of Navar and The Sultanate of Darcap, Marksel is a mining town whose old motto seemed to be, "Enough to Live With." A small group of sages, with their research, drives the demand for the mines rich metal.  As long as the work pays wages enough to keep the ale flowing from the nearby tavern, miners will be back at their post the following day.  Something has changed though, just as the hamlet was about to prosper, the trade roads leading to it fell under siege from bandits.  The merchant trade contracts have defaulted; the roads are too risky and unsafe. The forces of Lord Marksel have seen the tide of battle tip away from their favor.  Their hope dims with each passing day.
