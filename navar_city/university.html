<p>Map lore: The university features:
- professors with expanded dialog, to teach lore to players (only one for now)
- movers to make sure they stay in their building

This is still a work in progress, with plans to add:
- 2 or more levels (including the rooms above the main entrance)
- more specialists on many domains, to serve as a reference point to learn the lore of the world
- add animations, like 'hum, lemme check in a reference book', for certain topics
- maybe some quests to learn some lore / have someone talk to the player
</p>

<p>Monsters on map (level from 2 to 15): Professor Drolf, Professor Lordil, Professor Ulote, Shabrao.</p>
