We looked everywhere for it; who'd have thought they would take over this abandoned temple and hide the altar on the bottom!  We wonder what their motivation was... maybe they can't tell altars apart?  Or maybe they expected they'd be able to reconsecrate it?  Fools.
Anyway.  Praised be The Brave, The Just.  The altar is back where it belongs, in our chapel under the barracks.

You can't see down it very far though, because the way is blocked by a rockfall.  This seems to have happened after the Orcs came through, trapping them here.  You suspect that the cave-in may have been deliberate, which leads you to wonder; what were the orcs trying to block themselves off from?

        <li>About the Arena (18, 21)<pre>The Arena is a place where friends can fight each other without facing actual death penalties. Two players and 100 platinum are needed to enter; just go to the registration office to the north.
</pre></li>
        <li>How it Works (18, 20)<pre>Before combat, both players are given the opportunity to set certain conditions, such as obstacles, for the match. They can also decide to place winning bets. Peaceful mode is automatically ignored. This means that you can attack your opponents by simply running into them. The one who is victorious will gain all of the treasure. This is not required. The winner also receives one finger of the defeated foe as a trophy for victory. Neither combatant will earn experience.
</pre></li>
        <li>Safety (18, 19)<pre>The Arena Director takes safety very seriously. Because of this, the Arena is a very safe place. The loser will find himself in the first-aid station, with no loss of experience or stats. Moreoever, inside the arena, draining attacks don't take effect and acid doesn't harm equipment, so there is NOTHING to be afraid of.

The last of their line was Aljwaf the terrible.  His reign was bloody and he made enemies of all the neighbouring lands. His troops put women and children to the sword, he consorted with evil forces. It is said he cared for nothing save a single concubine. He fashioned a necklace for her made of one ruby, two emeralds and three sapphires. His reign ended when he was stricken with an unknown wasting disease and died horribly after a long illness. Some said the illness came from his evil dealings, they were quickly impaled for treason. Narcopin was razed to the ground by the surrounding kingdoms within six months of his death.

Try standing on top of the handle at your right and press the 'A'-key.  The gate will then open and a monster will try to attack you.  Run directly toward it to knock it down.  Good luck!
</pre></li>
        <li>Type an A to read (15, 25)<pre>You survived. That is promising ;->  As mentioned it is better the sooner you kill off the beasts.  That way they do not get so much time to hurt you.  To go really fast you can hold down the Control-key to run in a direction.  Try opening the gate at your right and run in by holding down the control-key and just pressing the direction key _once_.
</pre></li>
        <li>Read by typing an A (15, 22)<pre>Practice to run with the Control-key down once more.  Speed is very important in this game.  Another thing that you should know is that to fight many beasts at once can be dangerous.  You may be badly injured before you manage to kill them all off.  Well, go practice now!
</pre></li>
        <li>A A A A A .... (15, 19)<pre>It is time to get to know some other monsters.  Monsters generate from monster generators and you should try to destroy the generators as early as possible, to limit the number of monsters being produced.  So, open the gate at your right and destroy the face-shaped generator right away.  Do not waste time reading this ;-)
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (15, 16)<pre>Not all monsters have generators and not all monsters need a generator to reproduce.  Sometimes you get a reward for winning a hard battle.  By the way: Chests are opened by pressing the key 'A' while standing on top of them or by pressing 'a' if you have it in your inventory.  The middle mouse button can also be used.  Try it out.

The Undead Banisher is the weapon on the table behind me.  It's the prize of finishing the training.  It is one of the greatest weapon one can acquire.  It is feared by all undeads.  Its power grows with the master of the weapon.

        <li>Darcap-Navar Relations, by Poltihr (17, 17)<pre>The closest to Darcap, it was only logical Navar would help build a road joining its northern neighbourg around 6150 EK.
But Navar leaders were reluctant to trust the hordes of undead living in the town, so, according to Fuldar's research, they ensured the road joining the towns went through a narrow tunnel can could be destroyed easily, to sever the ties with Darcap if the need ever arised.
The tension between the towns was exacerbated when, in 6170 EK, the outpost of Navar south of Zaah's castle was assaulted by undead. It took many negotiations (and some say money was exchanged too, though no one could bring a formal proof) for the Navar forces to not retaliate.
</pre></li>
        <li>Short History of Darcap, by Alvanes (17, 16)<pre>Darcap was founded around 2265 EK, by the Kingdom of the Masts (on which few information is known). The colony was left isolated after the disappearance of this kingdom, and suffered for millenia afterwards.
During this period many inhabitants converted to Devourers to survive.
It is only in 6138 EK that the first stranger, Herghist Appelnisht, a famous explorer, set foot in the town. During his 2 years stay, he learnt the history and customs of Darcap and taught the whereabouts of the rest of the world to the inhabitants.
Navar then helped build a road connecting the two towns (some wonder why it goes through a narrow tunnel), and sponsored a shrine of Gaea.
To forget their awful past, and attract many visitors to not be forgotten again, Darcapians decided to build the biggest circus in the world, and a big port conducting business with the rest of the continent.
</pre></li>
        <li>Julio the Great, by Simpoe (17, 15)<pre>Not much is known of Julio's life before he came to Darcap. Some rumors say he was a great wizard knowing all about Elementals, working for kings or rich merchants, doing strange work for them.
His arrival in Darcap, in 6796 EK according to most sources though some like Ubnief say it is some years before or later, was pretty unnoticed at the time.
He purchased four houses in the center of the town (for quite a large sum it is argued), and started living there full time a few years after initially coming.
Quite shortly after that, though (the consensual date is 6798 EK), strange events started to occur in his rooms. Witnesses told of weird sounds, eruptions of flame or cold wind, and other disagreements.
A few years later, neighbours officially complained to the authorities for various explosions and destructions in their houses surrounding Julio's owns.
Quite isolated, with no friend known at the time, Julio lived alone, and died around 6804 EK.
It is only in 6813 EK that the sultan Marshi IV, having respected the dead wizard's wish to wait some years, published evidence showing Julio was a major element in the town's prosperity.
For years, and even before his arrival in the town proper, he had advised the sultan and his aids on the affairs of the world, favored the expansion of commerce to and from Darcap, and used his obviously great influence to enhance Darcap's circus (a full research can be found in Tilmuo's story).
As many inhabitants, including neighbours who did complain, started to tell how Julio did help them, solving many conflicts even as he was criticised, it was decided by popular consensus to make a statue of him out of gratitude.
His houses, escaping planned destruction, were restored, and became a museum to his work.

        <li>tome (37, 11)<pre>Spell Point regeneration rate controls how fast one's Spell Points are replenished.  Some races, such as elves, have an innately fast spell point regeneration.  Spell-casting classes also regenerate Spell Points at a faster rate.  Besides this, the equipment one uses may also affect spell point regeneration rate:
o  Some magical rings or amulets are resonant to the patterns of the aether, and cause Spell Points to flow into the wearer faster.  These items show a (magic+N) when identified.
o  Although some armour specially crafted for mages may increase spell point regeneration, in general most heavy armour will impede the flow of Spell Points into the wearer and slow down Spell Point regeneration rates.
o  Special weapons crafted for mages may also have Spell Point regeneration bonuses.
</pre></li>
        <li>exposition (37, 10)<pre>There are two factors controlling one's magical powers: Spell Point capacity, and Spell Point regeneration rate.  Spell Points is the force that drives magical spells; Spell Point capacity is how much Spell Points one can naturally have.  Spell Point regeneration rate is how fast the Spell Points are replenished.  Spell Point capacity is controlled mainly by one's power (Pow) and level of magic experience.  One's intelligence (Int) also affects this capacity, to a lesser degree.  Some magical equipment grant Pow bonuses, which will increase this capacity while worn.  Improvement potions may also permanently increase one's Spell Point capacity.  There are also very rare gemstones that have capacity to store Spell Points.  Spell Points stored in these crystals can be retrieved at a single touch.  High-level wizards use these stones to increase the total amount of Spell Points they have at their disposal.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (35, 11)<pre>The Glowing Crystal exhibited here is one of the rare gemstones that are able to store Spell Points.  Touching it when your Spell Points is at maximum capacity will transfer half your Spell Points into it.  Touching it when you are below maximum capacity will retrieve any stored Spell Points, up to your capacity.  This particular crystal can only store up to 200 Spell Points.  Crystals with capacities for 1000 Spell Points and beyond are known to exist; and are very much sought after by all spellcasters.

It's best to turn the box upside down and just shake it to let them out, and also prepare to be very charming.
As it is sometimes difficult to tame these magical pets, I have had my wife, who is a wizard, prepare a special pentagram.  Open your pet box above the pentagram and the pets you purchase here will be automatically charmed for you.  Opening them elsewhere may have unpredictable results.
All sales are final.

To play, have every racer position themself at the starting gate and then someone say 'start'.  This causes the gate to open.  After it opens, go to the right towards the finish line as fast as you can, but watch out for the jagged rocks and randomly generated 'strange water' which slows you down.  In order to tell who won, look at the order of the 'Racer x has finished!' and see who was first.

      <ul>
        <li>Boulderball Explanation (44, 11)<pre>To play boulderball, form two teams (a team can be 1-4 players) and have one team gather on one group of pentagrams, and the other team on the other, then say 'start' to be teleported in.  The goal of this game is to push the Boulderball into the opposing team's goal (reference the signs by the starting boxes for location information).  The game is won at 1 point, so upon a team scoring a goal, both teams are teleported out, and the winning team is declared.  (Warning: no tiles anywhere on this map are arena tiles, meaning that any kills anywhere on this map will be a PK with the usual penalties, so please do not do that.)  (Note: do not worry about accidentally pushing the boulder against a wall rendering it stuck--the wall lining denies boulders.  Also, players cannot stand inside the goal, to prevent them from just sitting right in there to block it.)  (Note: the teams start in a line in between the ball and their goal to prevent one team from just drilling the Boulderball into the opponent's goal right off the start.)

It is not restricted to 2 people at once... any number of people can play.  Also, it is open, meaning anyone can enter and leave whenever they want.  There are no trophies for killing either, since it is so unofficial and laid back.  Also, the fighting areas are much larger than the traditional arena, and offer varying circumstances to fight under.

A few moments after that is achieved, the starting gate will open.  The objective is to race the other person to the finish line.

Once that is achieved, both players will be teleported into the wrestling area. The goal of this game is to push your opponent outside of the wrestling area (onto the 'battleground' tiles) which will cause them to lose, and die (there is no death penalty though).  The remaining player will be teleported out upon victory. (WARNING: the only way this map can work is to have *only* the fatal/out-of-boundary area as arena tiles, that means if you use magic or go hostile and end up killing someone in the wrestling area or outside the safety fence, it will be a PK with the usual penalty, so please do not do that.

One ghost of an courageous warrior returned to warn me, when I was seeking the flying castle myself. "Keep to the right path to the forbidden peak, or you would end up in the catacomb."

        <li>How to buy a Guild (32, 22)<pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.

New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

        <li>How to buy a Guild (32, 22)<pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

        <li>Owners Guide (12, 14)<pre>Welcome to your new Guild House!
A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

        <li>Owner's Guide (27, 9)<pre>Welcome to your storage building.  This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

        <li>How to buy a Guild (32, 22)<pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

        <li>Owner's Guide (27, 9)<pre>Welcome to your storage building.  This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

        <li>How to buy a Guild (32, 22)<pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

        <li>Owners Guide (12, 14)<pre>Welcome to your new Guild House!
A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

        <li>How to buy a Guild (32, 22)<pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

        <li>Owners Guide (12, 14)<pre>Welcome to your new Guild House!
A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

        <li>Owner's Guide (27, 9)<pre>Welcome to your storage building.  This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

        <li>How to buy a Guild (32, 22)<pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

        <li>How to buy a Guild (32, 22)<pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

        <li>Owners Guide (12, 14)<pre>Welcome to your new Guild House!
A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

        <li>Owner's Guide (27, 9)<pre>Welcome to your storage building.  This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

        <li>Owner's Guide (27, 9)<pre>Welcome to your storage building.  This fine facility has a auto-storing feature, so that you can store all your items into their respective areas faster than normal.  Also, there are powerful anti magic fields all through this facility, to make it impossible to have your loot destroyed.  To use the auto sort feature, place items on the pits above, then pull the lever.  That causes the items to fall through tubes and end up in different rooms to your sorting delight.  Enjoy!

        <li>How to buy a Guild (32, 22)<pre>Three people are required to purchase a guild house.
To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

        <li>Owners Guide (12, 14)<pre>Welcome to your new Guild House!
A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

To purchase your guild house, you will need 100 amberium coins for the altar.
Two must stand on the pedestals in the first two alcoves and the third must take the payment into the third alcove.
When the third person has entered the third alcove the gates will be raised on the first two.
When the payment is made all three people shall be made GuildMasters and the way will be open to enter the guildhouse.
Remember, owning a guild is a very big responsibility.
If you are not ready for the time and effort involved perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

A few things to note, bugs should be reported to alestan@meflin.com.
In the upper left corner, there are two levers, the left one pays out fees and dues, fees are dropped onto the floor and dues go straight into your inventory.  The one on the right sets what happens if a non member tries to enter.  In the left position, they are held in a prison and must wait for the guild master, get a DM to help, or step into chaos long enough to word of recall out.  In the right position, it simply throws them out of the entry portal.  The work rooms are not player unique maps, so multiple people can enter the same work room.  The maps also do not reset, there is a small fee for using the maps, that the guild masters collect, use the funds from it to replace broken equipment.  To control who has access to the rooms, in the basement there are tokens, one of each kind is free, further ones must be purchased at ten gold apiece.  Once in a while the mechanism malfunctions and eats your money, just like a real vending machine, if this happens, sorry, just put more in and it should work.  You may buy four additional tokens per map reset, if you buy a fifth, it will refund your money and tell you it is sold out, putting more money in is simply eaten by the machine.  Questions or comments, please send them to alestan@meflin.com
New in this update:  Security system for the guild.  It's not perfect yet, but it catches most people trying to sneak into the guild.  Guild Storage room, the old storage hall is set up, thanks to Chad, to be a sorting/staging room.  It is not secure, so it is suggested that valuable items are not left unattended in it.  Also, if the gates are up in front of the stairs and you jump down one of the holes, a guildmaster will have to come rescue you because there is no way out.  New guild storage area is added under the guild.  The entrance is through the basement to the north.  This one splits up whose allowed to enter by guild rank.  Play around with it, most of the bugs should have been fixed already.
Known bugs:  Some areas may be accessible by dimension door that should not be accessible.  Some of the floor in the storage rooms beneath the guild hall may not be buildable.  Those are the major ones.
P.S.  This latest version now includes a security system.  Anyone caught on the mainfloor who does not belong is jailed for a random length of time between 15 minutes and four hours, or life.  Anyone caught entering the GM only area in the guild_hq, will be given one of 9 random curses.  At present, they must see a DM to have it removed.

        <li>magic_mouth (9, 30)<pre>Priest
As a priest, you've learned an intense devotion to your god, and you've learned how to channel the energies your god vouchsafes to his devotees.
You've been taught the use of weapons, but only cursorily, and your physical training has been lacking in general.
Since you're in tune with the holy powers, you can tell when a god has marked an object as accursed.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 28)<pre>Paladin
You are a militant priest, with an emphasis on 'priest'.
You've been taught archery and the use of weapons, but great care has been taken that you're doctrinally correct.  Now you've been sent out in the world to convert the unrighteous and destroy the enemies of the faith.  Your church members have been charged a pretty penny to equip you for the job!
All other areas of your education have been neglected.  Perhaps aware of your deficiency, your superiors have given you some measure of protection from magic.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 26)<pre>Monk
In the Monastery, they believed in mental discipline and peace through physical training, meditation, and, to a lesser extent, religious devotion.
Your mental equilibrium requires you to forego the use of weapons, but your physical training in karate means you're not helpless.
Your inner peace grants you the ability to regenerate faster and to sense metaphysical auras.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 24)<pre>Thief
Trained to be a thief from a young age, you've learned to steal and you're familiar with the value a fence will give you on your "finds".
You've had some weaponry training, including archery; this being advisable to someone who is likely to have acrimonious disagreements about the ownership of valuable objects.
You've had no time for either religious devotion or the study of magecraft, but your quick wits have been enough to keep you alive so far.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 22)<pre>Ninja
As a member of the secret society of the Ninja, you've been taught archery, the use of weapons, and also the art of combat without weapons.  Your style of combat, leans very much toward the sneak attack, so you've been taught how to be inconspicuous and to appear in places you're not expected.
You have had no introduction to either religious devotion or magic.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 20)<pre>Swashbuckler
Shipboard most of your life, you've learned good balance and agility, and you've also become strong and hardy.  Because of occasional oars work, you and your shipmates have an admirable command of rhythm, and you can sing well.
You've learned to make the most of your time in port:  after passing out drunk in a bar and waking to find yourself short your pay, you've found ways to acquire new capital, or at the very least, talk someone into helping you out of your fix.
On numerous occasions, you've taken up arms and bow in defense of your ship, so you're facile with weapons, but you've had no chance to learn magic or the ways of gods.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 18)<pre>Barbarian
Growing up in the howling wilderness, you've had no chance to pursue anything remotely intellectual, let alone learn your letters!  It's amazing you ever thought of leaving your hovel and going somewhere else, you're so ignorant.  But now you have.
You find that you're a lot tougher and stronger than these city folk, and you know how to get around in rough terrain.  You've learned archery in order to fill your cook pot, and weaponry is second nature to anyone who's had to fight with the local orc-tribe over food once a month.
You're deeply afraid of magic, and it'll be a while before you get over that and develop any facility with it.
You've no deep problem with the idea of gods, but you don't know much about them.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 16)<pre>Warrior
As a Warrior you've been trained in the art of combat with weapons and in archery.
Because of your training, you're stronger, more agile, and hardier than you would be otherwise.
Your education, however, has not included studies in the magical arts or religious devotion, and, in general, lacks breadth.

</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 14)<pre>Crossfire Primer #6.
Religions
Religions are acquired by praying at an altar.  Any player with the praying skill may pray at an altar and become a devotee of that god.
The deities are very different from each other and can vastly affect how the game is played.  Beginning players should probably choose either Mostrai or Valriel, and should probably avoid Gaea and Ruggilli.
Praying at an altar can have a number of advantages.  For example, your god may grant you extra grace points, or may spontaneously bless you with some unexpected boon.  Don't give up on praying at the altar as sometimes it takes quite a bit of prayer to convince your god that you are worthy.
Temples for most of the religions may be found in the town of Scorn, where new players should go after selecting a class.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 14)<pre>To begin choosing a character class, walk into the room ahead.  Examine the different classes by stepping on the first tile of each aisle.  When you find a class that appeals to you, walk forward onto the teleport circle for that class.  At that point, your character usually assumes the appearance of the fellow standing at the end of the aisle.
Note that your character's statistics like strength, dexterity, and so on, will be automatically adjusted according the chosen class.  Keep this in mind when making a selection. Some statistics will get higher, and others will get lower.
It may be helpful to choose a class keeping in mind which statistics are high and low.  For example, it may not be wise to pick a warrior class if your character has very low strength, and electing a magical class with a very low power statistic may prevent your character from using magic until artifacts may be found that raise your characters statistics to a useful level.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 13)<pre>Crossfire Primer #5:
Prayers
Players with the praying skill can ask help of their gods.  Prayers and magical spells are used in much the same way as magic spells.  For example:
cast holy word
cast cause light wounds
These commands set a ranged attack to that prayer.  Then, like other ranged weapons, the spell is "fired" in a direction to invoke the prayer.  The "invoke" command also works with praying spells.
Grace is a measure of how pleased your god is with you at the moment.  Your god will grant you favors if you have sufficient grace, or even sometimes when you don't.
Asking for a big favor when you have insufficient grace may bring down divine retribution, so watch your grace meter when casting spells.
Grace is slowly replenished, up to a point.  You must pray to gain more grace, or gain it faster than the natural replenishment rate.  The following command may be used to set up a convenient way to pray:
bind use_skill praying
P
This is called keybinding, and sets up a hotkey for a commonly entered text command.  After binding the command to the P key, pressing P causes your character to pray.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 12)<pre>Crossfire Primer #4:
Magic
Players with magical skills may cast mana-based spells.  Magic skills are split into sub-groups called evocation, pyromancy, sorcery, and summoning, and are used by typing commands.  For example:
cast small lightning
cast burning hands
The cast command "readies" a spell and selects a ranged attack to prepare for "firing" magic.  To invoke the spell, fire, or shoot, in some direction after it has been readied.  It is also possible to invoke a spell without having to fire or ready it.  For example:
invoke word of recall
invoke small lightning
Using the invoke command does not change the melee or ranged weapon selection.
Magical energy is called mana and is depleted whenever a player invokes a magical spell.   Mana is normally replenished slowly, but certain items may speed the recharging process.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 11)<pre>Crossfire Primer #3:
Skills
Crossfire players can have many skills.  Type in the command "skills" to see which ones you have.  Remember, the apostrophe key is used to begin entering typed commands.  At the moment your character will have few or no skills.  Selecting your character class is the way to choose your beginning skill set.
The primary skills are organized into groups that represent abilities to use various forms of magic, weapons, and praying, but there are also many other skills that do not fall into these broad categories.
Some skills are used by typing in commands like this:
use_skill alchemy
Other skills, like praying, weapons, and magic are used automatically.  Skills may be inherent to your character, but they may also be acquired by using items like talismans, holy symbols, or other inventory items.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 10)<pre>Crossfire Primer #2:
Basic movement and melee combat.
During your adventures, you often need to battle monsters.  If you want to physically strike a monster, just run into him with your player, many times, and quickly.  This is called melee combat.  To combat foes or escape with your life, learn the keyboard commands for running and moving.
Move using the following keys, or by using arrow key clusters or numeric key pads present on many keyboards:
yku
h l
bjn
To run, hold the <Ctrl> key and press a direction key.  When you run, it is not necessary to repeatedly press direction keys.  You move in the indicated direction until the direction key is released.
It is better to hit a monster with a weapon rather than with fists.  Click on your inventory until you figure out how to get a weapon "wielded".  Once that is done, you'll be able to hit the monster with the weapon when you run into him.
Melee combat can be very effective, but be careful.  Some monsters do a great deal of damage to character and equipment during close combat, and yet others are unaffected by physical damage, though these monsters do not appear in the easy dungeons you will play first.
To avoid melee combat, use ranged weapons like bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, or magic.  Fire such ranged weapons by pressing the <Shift> key in combination with a direction key.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 9)<pre>Crossfire Primer #1:
How to pick up, drop, and apply things.
On this square there is a piece of food.  Click around with various mouse buttons.  One of the buttons will cause you to apply (eat) the food.  Another button is used to pick up or drop items.  It is important to get comfortable with pickup and drop early so that you do not accidentally drop things that are given to you after you select a class.  Some of those items will disappear forever if you drop them.
The mouse is not the only way to do things.  Keyboard keys are used also.  For example, the "," (comma) key is quick way to pick up objects you are standing on.
Crossfire also has a rich set of text commands.  To begin entering a text command, use the apostrophe (') key.  On most modern clients, this places your cursor in a text entry box.
To pick up, drop, or apply objects, type an apostrophe followed by an appropriate text command.  For example, typing a text command "take all" gets everything off of the floor at once.  You can even be more specific by using an objects name.  For example, "drop food" will cause all items named food to be dropped.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 8)<pre>Welcome to the Hall of Selection.
Here you pick a character class.  Each class starts out with different skills.  Picking a class here does not permanently affect the skills you know as it is quite possible to 'train' your character in additional skills.  Like a person, a character can learn a new career if his native abilities allow it.
Selection of a class also affects the appearance of your character on the game board.  Even though a character may assume a new vocation by learning new skills, the appearance chosen here is permanent.
On this walk toward your destiny, some basic game concepts will be offered to prepare you for your adventures.  Do not worry too much about all the details yet.  After you select a class, you will have another chance to learn more about how to start playing Crossfire.

The axis of your existence is your devotion to your god, but you've also been busy in other areas.
Your sensitivity to godly powers has also caused your natural magical ability to bloom, and your religious order has encouraged your study.
Your religious superiors have forced you to learn weaponry against your choice, but you will find that they were wise to do so.  You haven't trained as assiduously as you should have, so you are soft and weak.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 26)<pre>Sorcerer
Your study of magic has been obsessive.  Your frequent practice has greatly enhanced your powers, and your intellect has been sharpened enormously by your quest for ever better ways to channel energies.
Barbarians used to push you around on the street until you blasted one's leg off with a lightning bolt.  You reflected later on the stupidity of this, because you could by no means have blasted his friends, too.  Fortunately, they ran off.  You resolved to learn how to take out a whole group of barbarians before losing your temper again.
On the other hand, you have totally neglected to learn to use weaponry, so you're soft and weak.
Your study of magical devices allows you to notice when an object has a magical aura, and you are often able to fathom the purpose of magical devices.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 24)<pre>Alchemist
Your specialty is magical devices and concoctions, but you've also had some training in weaponry, so that you could fend off townsfolk angered by the vile reeks that frequently emanate from your workshop.
Searching for the ultimate recipe and trying to recover lost knowledge has sharpened your wits considerably.
Your focus, however, has left little time for physical training, and your sedentary lifestyle has weakened you.
Your dependence on magical devices extends to the use of a talisman to channel mana.  The talisman has become attuned to detonation and transmutation because of the way you have used it.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 22)<pre>Wizard
You're the generalist of the spellcasters.  You've emphasized the use of magic and studied all its areas equally.
You've learned something about the gods and religious devotion as well.
To a much lesser extent, you've studied weaponry, but you've not had much physical training:  you're mostly sedentary, and so you're not nearly so strong and healthy as you could be.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 20)<pre>Summoner
You've had more of an emphasis on physical training than most spellcasters, at the expense of less practice with spellcasting.  You've never learned to use magic innately, but instead rely on a magic talisman to channel mana for you.
Your work has leaned heavily toward the art of summoning creatures to help you in a fight, and your talisman has become attuned to that.  That attunement, however, makes it harder for you to reject unwanted creatures.
You've also had a reasonable education in religious devotion.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 18)<pre>Evoker
Your specialty is the use of attack spells in combat.  You practice these spells daily, and your capacity to cast them has increased hugely.
You've had some training in weaponry to help defend yourself, but you tend to leave most of the fighting to others, so your physical training has been somewhat lacking.
You've never learned to use magic innately, but instead rely on a magic talisman to channel mana for you.  The attack spells have imprinted themselves somewhat on your talisman, making it good for those and less useful for anything else.
You have not been trained in religious devotion:  however, you come from a religious family and will have no particular difficulty taking up the service of a god.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 16)<pre>Warlock
You've divided your time between learning magic and learning weapons, but have totally disregarded religious devotion.
You're physically stronger and hardier because of your training, and you know the use of weapons and bows.  However, you're just a bit clumsy in both weaponry and magic because you've had to divide your time between them.

As a member of the secret society of the Ninja, you've been taught archery, the use of weapons, and also the art of combat without weapons.  Your style of combat, leans very much toward the sneak attack, so you've been taught how to be inconspicuous and to appear in places you're not expected.

Growing up in the howling wilderness, you've had no chance to pursue anything remotely intellectual, let alone learn your letters!  It's amazing you ever thought of leaving your hovel and going somewhere else, you're so ignorant.  But now you have.
You find that you're a lot tougher and stronger than these city folk, and you know how to get around in rough terrain.  You've learned archery in order to fill your cook pot, and weaponry is second nature to anyone who's had to fight with the local orc-tribe over food once a month.
You're deeply afraid of magic, and it'll be a while before you get over that and develop any facility with it.
You've no deep problem with the idea of gods, but you don't know much about them.

As a Warrior you've been trained in the art of combat with weapons and in archery.
Because of your training, you're stronger, more agile, and hardier than you would be otherwise.
Your education, however, has not included studies in the magical arts or religious devotion, and, in general, lacks breadth.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 15)<pre>To begin choosing a character class, walk into the room ahead.  Examine the different classes by stepping on the first tile of each aisle.  When you find a class that appeals to you, walk forward onto the teleport circle for that class.
Note that your character's statistics like strength, dexterity, and so on, will be automatically adjusted according the chosen class.  Keep this in mind when making a selection. Some statistics will get higher, and others will get lower.
It may be helpful to choose a class keeping in mind which statistics are high and low.  For example, it may not be wise to pick a warrior class if your character has very low strength, and electing a magical class with a very low power statistic may prevent your character from using magic until artifacts may be found that raise your characters statistics to a useful level.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 14)<pre>Crossfire Primer #6.
Religions
Religions are acquired by praying at an altar.  Any player with the praying skill may pray at an altar and become a devotee of that god.
The deities are very different from each other and can vastly affect how the game is played.  Beginning players should probably choose either Mostrai or Valriel, and should probably avoid Gaea and Ruggilli.
Praying at an altar can have a number of advantages.  For example, your god may grant you extra grace points, or may spontaneously bless you with some unexpected boon.  Don't give up on praying at the altar as sometimes it takes quite a bit of prayer to convince your god that you are worthy.
Temples for most of the religions may be found in the town of Scorn, where new players should go after selecting a class.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 13)<pre>Crossfire Primer #5:
Prayers
Players with the praying skill can ask help of their gods.  Prayers and magical spells are used in much the same way as magic spells.  For example:
cast holy word
cast cause light wounds
These commands set a ranged attack to that prayer.  Then, like other ranged weapons, the spell is "fired" in a direction to invoke the prayer.  The "invoke" command also works with praying spells.
Grace is a measure of how pleased your god is with you at the moment.  Your god will grant you favors if you have sufficient grace, or even sometimes when you don't.
Asking for a big favor when you have insufficient grace may bring down divine retribution, so watch your grace meter when casting spells.
Grace is slowly replenished, up to a point.  You must pray to gain more grace, or gain it faster than the natural replenishment rate.  The following command may be used to set up a convenient way to pray:
bind use_skill praying
P
This is called keybinding, and sets up a hotkey for a commonly entered text command.  After binding the command to the P key, pressing P causes your character to pray.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 12)<pre>Crossfire Primer #4:
Magic
Players with magical skills may cast mana-based spells.  Magic skills are split into sub-groups called evocation, pyromancy, sorcery, and summoning, and are used by typing commands.  For example:
cast small lightning
cast burning hands
The cast command "readies" a spell and selects a ranged attack to prepare for "firing" magic.  To invoke the spell, fire, or shoot, in some direction after it has been readied.  It is also possible to invoke a spell without having to fire or ready it.  For example:
invoke word of recall
invoke small lightning
Using the invoke command does not change the melee or ranged weapon selection.
Magical energy is called mana and is depleted whenever a player invokes a magical spell.   Mana is normally replenished slowly, but certain items may speed the recharging process.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 11)<pre>Crossfire Primer #3:
Skills
Crossfire players can have many skills.  Type in the command "skills" to see which ones you have.  Remember, the apostrophe key is used to begin entering typed commands.  At the moment your character will have few or no skills.  Selecting your character class is the way to choose your beginning skill set.
The primary skills are organized into groups that represent abilities to use various forms of magic, weapons, and praying, but there are also many other skills that do not fall into these broad categories.
Some skills are used by typing in commands like this:
use_skill alchemy
Other skills, like praying, weapons, and magic are used automatically.  Skills may be inherent to your character, but they may also be acquired by using items like talismans, holy symbols, or other inventory items.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 10)<pre>Crossfire Primer #2:
Basic movement and melee combat.
During your adventures, you often need to battle monsters.  If you want to physically strike a monster, just run into him with your player, many times, and quickly.  This is called melee combat.  To combat foes or escape with your life, learn the keyboard commands for running and moving.
Move using the following keys, or by using arrow key clusters or numeric key pads present on many keyboards:
yku
h l
bjn
To run, hold the <Ctrl> key and press a direction key.  When you run, it is not necessary to repeatedly press direction keys.  You move in the indicated direction until the direction key is released.
It is better to hit a monster with a weapon rather than with fists.  Click on your inventory until you figure out how to get a weapon "wielded".  Once that is done, you'll be able to hit the monster with the weapon when you run into him.
Melee combat can be very effective, but be careful.  Some monsters do a great deal of damage to character and equipment during close combat, and yet others are unaffected by physical damage, though these monsters do not appear in the easy dungeons you will play first.
To avoid melee combat, use ranged weapons like bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, or magic.  Fire such ranged weapons by pressing the <Shift> key in combination with a direction key.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 9)<pre>Crossfire Primer #1:
How to pick up, drop, and apply things.
On this square there is a piece of food.  Click around with various mouse buttons.  One of the buttons will cause you to apply (eat) the food.  Another button is used to pick up or drop items.  It is important to get comfortable with pickup and drop early so that you do not accidentally drop things that are given to you after you select a class.  Some of those items will disappear forever if you drop them.
The mouse is not the only way to do things.  Keyboard keys are used also.  For example, the "," (comma) key is quick way to pick up objects you are standing on.
Crossfire also has a rich set of text commands.  To begin entering a text command, use the apostrophe (') key.  On most modern clients, this places your cursor in a text entry box.
To pick up, drop, or apply objects, type an apostrophe followed by an appropriate text command.  For example, typing a text command "take all" gets everything off of the floor at once.  You can even be more specific by using an objects name.  For example, "drop food" will cause all items named food to be dropped.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 8)<pre>Welcome to the Hall of Selection.
Here you pick a character class.  Each class starts out with different skills.  Picking a class here does not permanently affect the skills you know as it is quite possible to 'train' your character in additional skills.  Like a person, a character can learn a new career if his native abilities allow it.
On this walk toward your destiny, some basic game concepts will be offered to prepare you for your adventures.  Do not worry too much about all the details yet.  After you select a class, you will have another chance to learn more about how to start playing Crossfire.

Note that your character's statistics like strength, dexterity, and so on, will be automatically adjusted according the chosen class.  Keep this in mind when making a selection. Some statistics will get higher, and others will get lower.
It may be helpful to choose a class keeping in mind which statistics are high and low.  For example, it may not be wise to pick a warrior class if your character has very low strength, and electing a magical class with a very low power statistic may prevent your character from using magic until artifacts may be found that raise your characters statistics to a useful level.

Religions
Religions are acquired by praying at an altar.  Any player with the praying skill may pray at an altar and become a devotee of that god.
The deities are very different from each other and can vastly affect how the game is played.  Beginning players should probably choose either Mostrai or Valriel, and should probably avoid Gaea and Ruggilli.
Praying at an altar can have a number of advantages.  For example, your god may grant you extra grace points, or may spontaneously bless you with some unexpected boon.  Don't give up on praying at the altar as sometimes it takes quite a bit of prayer to convince your god that you are worthy.
Temples for most of the religions may be found in the town of Scorn, where new players should go after selecting a class.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 13)<pre>Crossfire Primer #5:
Prayers
Players with the praying skill can ask help of their gods.  Prayers and magical spells are used in much the same way as magic spells.  For example:
cast holy word
cast cause light wounds
These commands set a ranged attack to that prayer.  Then, like other ranged weapons, the spell is "fired" in a direction to invoke the prayer.  The "invoke" command also works with praying spells.
Grace is a measure of how pleased your god is with you at the moment.  Your god will grant you favors if you have sufficient grace, or even sometimes when you don't.
Asking for a big favor when you have insufficient grace may bring down divine retribution, so watch your grace meter when casting spells.
Grace is slowly replenished, up to a point.  You must pray to gain more grace, or gain it faster than the natural replenishment rate.  The following command may be used to set up a convenient way to pray:
bind use_skill praying
P
This is called keybinding, and sets up a hotkey for a commonly entered text command.  After binding the command to the P key, pressing P causes your character to pray.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 12)<pre>Crossfire Primer #4:
Magic
Players with magical skills may cast mana-based spells.  Magic skills are split into sub-groups called evocation, pyromancy, sorcery, and summoning, and are used by typing commands.  For example:
cast small lightning
cast burning hands
The cast command "readies" a spell and selects a ranged attack to prepare for "firing" magic.  To invoke the spell, fire, or shoot, in some direction after it has been readied.  It is also possible to invoke a spell without having to fire or ready it.  For example:
invoke word of recall
invoke small lightning
Using the invoke command does not change the melee or ranged weapon selection.
Magical energy is called mana and is depleted whenever a player invokes a magical spell.   Mana is normally replenished slowly, but certain items may speed the recharging process.

Skills
Crossfire players can have many skills.  Type in the command "skills" to see which ones you have.  Remember, the apostrophe key is used to begin entering typed commands.  At the moment your character will have few or no skills.  Selecting your character class is the way to choose your beginning skill set.
The primary skills are organized into groups that represent abilities to use various forms of magic, weapons, and praying, but there are also many other skills that do not fall into these broad categories.
Some skills are used by typing in commands like this:
use_skill alchemy
Other skills, like praying, weapons, and magic are used automatically.  Skills may be inherent to your character, but they may also be acquired by using items like talismans, holy symbols, or other inventory items.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (7, 10)<pre>Crossfire Primer #2:
Basic movement and melee combat.
During your adventures, you often need to battle monsters.  If you want to physically strike a monster, just run into him with your player, many times, and quickly.  This is called melee combat.  To combat foes or escape with your life, learn the keyboard commands for running and moving.
Move using the following keys, or by using arrow key clusters or numeric key pads present on many keyboards:
yku
h l
bjn
To run, hold the <Ctrl> key and press a direction key.  When you run, it is not necessary to repeatedly press direction keys.  You move in the indicated direction until the direction key is released.
It is better to hit a monster with a weapon rather than with fists.  Click on your inventory until you figure out how to get a weapon "wielded".  Once that is done, you'll be able to hit the monster with the weapon when you run into him.
Melee combat can be very effective, but be careful.  Some monsters do a great deal of damage to character and equipment during close combat, and yet others are unaffected by physical damage, though these monsters do not appear in the easy dungeons you will play first.
To avoid melee combat, use ranged weapons like bows, crossbows, throwing weapons, or magic.  Fire such ranged weapons by pressing the <Shift> key in combination with a direction key.

How to pick up, drop, and apply things.
On this square there is a piece of food.  Click around with various mouse buttons.  One of the buttons will cause you to apply (eat) the food.  Another button is used to pick up or drop items.  It is important to get comfortable with pickup and drop early so that you do not accidentally drop things that are given to you after you select a class.  Some of those items will disappear forever if you drop them.
The mouse is not the only way to do things.  Keyboard keys are used also.  For example, the "," (comma) key is quick way to pick up objects you are standing on.
Crossfire also has a rich set of text commands.  To begin entering a text command, use the apostrophe (') key.  On most modern clients, this places your cursor in a text entry box.
To pick up, drop, or apply objects, type an apostrophe followed by an appropriate text command.  For example, typing a text command "take all" gets everything off of the floor at once.  You can even be more specific by using an objects name.  For example, "drop food" will cause all items named food to be dropped.

        <li>magic_mouth (5, 35)<pre>Devotee
The axis of your existence is your devotion to your god, but you've also been busy in other areas.
Your sensitivity to godly powers has also caused your natural magical ability to bloom, and your religious order has encouraged your study.
Your religious superiors have forced you to learn weaponry against your choice, but you will find that they were wise to do so.  You haven't trained as assiduously as you should have, so you are soft and weak.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 33)<pre>Sorcerer
Your study of magic has been obsessive.  Your frequent practice has greatly enhanced your powers, and your intellect has been sharpened enormously by your quest for ever better ways to channel energies.
Barbarians used to push you around on the street until you blasted one's leg off with a lightning bolt.  You reflected later on the stupidity of this, because you could by no means have blasted his friends, too.  Fortunately, they ran off.  You resolved to learn how to take out a whole group of barbarians before losing your temper again.
On the other hand, you have totally neglected to learn to use weaponry, so you're soft and weak.
Your study of magical devices allows you to notice when an object has a magical aura, and you are often able to fathom the purpose of magical devices.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 31)<pre>Alchemist
Your specialty is magical devices and concoctions, but you've also had some training in weaponry, so that you could fend off townsfolk angered by the vile reeks that frequently emanate from your workshop.
Searching for the ultimate recipe and trying to recover lost knowledge has sharpened your wits considerably.
Your focus, however, has left little time for physical training, and your sedentary lifestyle has weakened you.
Your dependence on magical devices extends to the use of a talisman to channel mana.  The talisman has become attuned to detonation and transmutation because of the way you have used it.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 29)<pre>Wizard
You're the generalist of the spellcasters.  You've emphasized the use of magic and studied all its areas equally.
You've learned something about the gods and religious devotion as well.
To a much lesser extent, you've studied weaponry, but you've not had much physical training:  you're mostly sedentary, and so you're not nearly so strong and healthy as you could be.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 27)<pre>Summoner
You've had more of an emphasis on physical training than most spellcasters, at the expense of less practice with spellcasting.  You've never learned to use magic innately, but instead rely on a magic talisman to channel mana for you.
Your work has leaned heavily toward the art of summoning creatures to help you in a fight, and your talisman has become attuned to that.  That attunement, however, makes it harder for you to reject unwanted creatures.
You've also had a reasonable education in religious devotion.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 25)<pre>Evoker
Your specialty is the use of attack spells in combat.  You practice these spells daily, and your capacity to cast them has increased hugely.
You've had some training in weaponry to help defend yourself, but you tend to leave most of the fighting to others, so your physical training has been somewhat lacking.
You've never learned to use magic innately, but instead rely on a magic talisman to channel mana for you.  The attack spells have imprinted themselves somewhat on your talisman, making it good for those and less useful for anything else.
You have not been trained in religious devotion:  however, you come from a religious family and will have no particular difficulty taking up the service of a god.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 23)<pre>Warlock
You've divided your time between learning magic and learning weapons, but have totally disregarded religious devotion.
You're physically stronger and hardier because of your training, and you know the use of weapons and bows.  However, you're just a bit clumsy in both weaponry and magic because you've had to divide your time between them.

        <li>magic_mouth (9, 29)<pre>Priest
As a priest, you've learned an intense devotion to your god, and you've learned how to channel the energies your god vouchsafes to his devotees.
You've been taught the use of weapons, but only cursorily, and your physical training has been lacking in general.
Since you're in tune with the holy powers, you can tell when a god has marked an object as accursed.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 27)<pre>Paladin
You are a militant priest, with an emphasis on 'priest'.
You've been taught archery and the use of weapons, but great care has been taken that you're doctrinally correct.  Now you've been sent out in the world to convert the unrighteous and destroy the enemies of the faith.  Your church members have been charged a pretty penny to equip you for the job!
All other areas of your education have been neglected.  Perhaps aware of your deficiency, your superiors have given you some measure of protection from magic.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 25)<pre>Monk
In the Monastery, they believed in mental discipline and peace through physical training, meditation, and, to a lesser extent, religious devotion.
Your mental equilibrium requires you to forego the use of weapons, but your physical training in karate means you're not helpless.
Your inner peace grants you the ability to regenerate faster and to sense metaphysical auras.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 23)<pre>Thief
Trained to be a thief from a young age, you've learned to steal and you're familiar with the value a fence will give you on your "finds".
You've had some weaponry training, including archery; this being advisable to someone who is likely to have acrimonious disagreements about the ownership of valuable objects.
You've had no time for either religious devotion or the study of magecraft, but your quick wits have been enough to keep you alive so far.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 21)<pre>Ninja
As a member of the secret society of the Ninja, you've been taught archery, the use of weapons, and also the art of combat without weapons.  Your style of combat, leans very much toward the sneak attack, so you've been taught how to be inconspicuous and to appear in places you're not expected.
You have had no introduction to either religious devotion or magic.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 19)<pre>Swashbuckler
Shipboard most of your life, you've learned good balance and agility, and you've also become strong and hardy.  Because of occasional oars work, you and your shipmates have an admirable command of rhythm, and you can sing well.
You've learned to make the most of your time in port:  after passing out drunk in a bar and waking to find yourself short your pay, you've found ways to acquire new capital, or at the very least, talk someone into helping you out of your fix.
On numerous occasions, you've taken up arms and bow in defense of your ship, so you're facile with weapons, but you've had no chance to learn magic or the ways of gods.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (9, 17)<pre>Barbarian
Growing up in the howling wilderness, you've had no chance to pursue anything remotely intellectual, let alone learn your letters!  It's amazing you ever thought of leaving your hovel and going somewhere else, you're so ignorant.  But now you have.
You find that you're a lot tougher and stronger than these city folk, and you know how to get around in rough terrain.  You've learned archery in order to fill your cook pot, and weaponry is second nature to anyone who's had to fight with the local orc-tribe over food once a month.
You're deeply afraid of magic, and it'll be a while before you get over that and develop any facility with it.
You've no deep problem with the idea of gods, but you don't know much about them.

Your specialty is the use of attack spells in combat.  You practice these spells daily, and your capacity to cast them has increased hugely.
You've had some training in weaponry to help defend yourself, but you tend to leave most of the fighting to others, so your physical training has been somewhat lacking.
You've never learned to use magic innately, but instead rely on a magic talisman to channel mana for you.  The attack spells have imprinted themselves somewhat on your talisman, making it good for those and less useful for anything else.
You have not been trained in religious devotion:  however, you come from a religious family and will have no particular difficulty taking up the service of a god.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (5, 15)<pre>Warlock
You've divided your time between learning magic and learning weapons, but have totally disregarded religious devotion.
You're physically stronger and hardier because of your training, and you know the use of weapons and bows.  However, you're just a bit clumsy in both weaponry and magic because you've had to divide your time between them.

minor healing

heal
restoration
The healing potion is equivalent to the heal spell. The Restoration spell does NOT restore depleted stats.
</pre></li>
        <li>On the Cure of Disease (10, 26)<pre>You find a lengthy treatise on disease and its cure.  Some diseases, apparently, are more difficult to cure than others, and require a higher level of skill.  Other diseases can be expected to run their course and go away without causing serious harm, unless of course, one is in a situation in which temporary incapacity is fatal.  The cure disease spell is effective against disease, except as remarked above.  Restoration also works well against disease.  Cure wounds spells won't cure disease, but they will reduce symptoms.  Cure wounds spells therefore can be used to keep a person alive until the disease may be cured.  Also, they may keep him alive until the disease naturally goes away.  There are also claims of herbal, alchemical, animal, or other magical cures for disease, but these belong in another treatise.

        <li>tome (37, 11)<pre>Spell Point regeneration rate controls how fast one's Spell Points are replenished.  Some races, such as elves, have an innately fast spell point regeneration.  Spell-casting classes also regenerate Spell Points at a faster rate.  Besides this, the equipment one uses may also affect spell point regeneration rate:
o  Some magical rings or amulets are resonant to the patterns of the aether, and cause Spell Points to flow into the wearer faster.  These items show a (magic+N) when identified.
o  Although some armour specially crafted for mages may increase spell point regeneration, in general most heavy armour will impede the flow of Spell Points into the wearer and slow down Spell Point regeneration rates.
o  Special weapons crafted for mages may also have Spell Point regeneration bonuses.
</pre></li>
        <li>exposition (37, 10)<pre>There are two factors controlling one's magical powers: Spell Point capacity, and Spell Point regeneration rate.  Spell Points is the force that drives magical spells; Spell Point capacity is how much Spell Points one can naturally have.  Spell Point regeneration rate is how fast the Spell Points are replenished.  Spell Point capacity is controlled mainly by one's power (Pow) and level of magic experience.  One's intelligence (Int) also affects this capacity, to a lesser degree.  Some magical equipment grant Pow bonuses, which will increase this capacity while worn.  Improvement potions may also permanently increase one's Spell Point capacity.  There are also very rare gemstones that have capacity to store Spell Points.  Spell Points stored in these crystals can be retrieved at a single touch.  High-level wizards use these stones to increase the total amount of Spell Points they have at their disposal.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (35, 11)<pre>The Glowing Crystal exhibited here is one of the rare gemstones that are able to store Spell Points.  Touching it when your Spell Points is at maximum capacity will transfer half your Spell Points into it.  Touching it when you are below maximum capacity will retrieve any stored Spell Points, up to your capacity.  This particular crystal can only store up to 200 Spell Points.  Crystals with capacities for 1000 Spell Points and beyond are known to exist; and are very much sought after by all spellcasters.

        <li>research 6 (13, 1)<pre> Gothwolte was so sure of his invulnerability, he always travelled and fought on his own.  One day an enemy mage from the east set a pit trap for Gothwolte.  Gothwolte fell in that very deep hole and it was quickly filled up by the mage.  Gothwolte was immortal - but his body, the warrior was not.  The warrior died of starvation and his flesh decayed.  Gothwolte, without a body to control, couldn't move again...
</pre></li>
        <li>research 5 (12, 1)<pre> Gothwolte lived in the castle of the Evil Masters, south of the ancient lake.  While his powers rose, the Evil Masters accepted him as their leader.  Gothwolte was about to become emperor of the whole world.  But then he made a mistake...
</pre></li>
        <li>research 4 (11, 1)<pre> As he grew stronger, Gothwolte learned to command the fighter through the sword.  While under control of Gothwolte, the fighter continued to search for immunity scrolls, because improving the sword meant improving Gothwolte himself.  His powers increased with every scroll and one day he finally was immune to everything - Gothwolte was invulnerable.
</pre></li>
        <li>research 3 (10, 1)<pre> There were many powerful improvement scrolls available in the ancient world.  Weapon protection to fire, cold, ..., Weapon immunity to physical, electricity, ... and many more.  The fighter improved the sword by using many of these scrolls.  The weapon enchantments also had an affect on Gothwolte.  He also he gained protections and immunities.  He started to recover and heal.
</pre></li>
        <li>research 2 (9, 1)<pre> One day, Gothwolte was drawn to the power of an ancient dancing sword.  His lust for power caused him to seek spirtual posession of the sword.   But the magical sword was different from controlling a living being.  Gothwolte was badly injured during the process.  He was also trapped in the sword, unable to move.  By chance, a strong warrior came along just then.  He picked up the sword and wielded it.
</pre></li>
        <li>research 1 (8, 1)<pre> Gothwolte is some kind of ancient ghost.  It's origin is unknown.  It has a special skill, it can possess the living.

The landscape around Brest makes a return dragon flight not possible. So when travelling to the great Kingdom of Brittany, you will have to find your own way home. Either through magical means or brave the dangerous and deadly ice swept path through the mountains.
You have been warned!
Say, "Dangerous return" to open the gate to purchase your flight ticket.

Times are actual playing time, so a character has to be logged in in order for their time to expire.
Saying 'sorry' in a cell will deliver bread and water to a character.
Teleporters are damned, so the characters save bed will be changed to the center of their cell. They will not be able to suicide and get out early.
The Warden's key will allow you to open cell doors when you are not flying (dm). Prisoners will not be able to leave even if the door is open.

Before he was imprisoned in the fortress he lived in his tower to the northeast and use the cave near the mountain to do research.  The tower is deserted and is occupied by some unknown hosts.

</pre></li>
        <li>Notes on Ruggilli (6, 10)<pre>To Whom it may concern,
Ruggilli is the true God of destruction.  His power is the strength behind the mighty red dragons.  You too can share this power, but at a cost.  If you proceed with Ruggilli you will liken yourself to Him.  Ruggilli has an immense appetite, you will find yourself eating more than is normal, carry a little extra food and you need not worry, but woe if you run out.  As a follower of Ruggilli, his protections and vulnerabilities are also shared.  You will become more resistant to fire but less to cold, also your very skin will protect you from any physical projectile.  This will compensate for your inability to wear armour as Ruggilli deems such items lowly.  Ruggilli is a god of chaos, you must use this to your advantage.  A quick attack is your main strength as Ruggilli will immolate all your enemies.  Be warned though, creatures immune to fire shall not be harmed by Ruggilli's will.  If you prove yourself worthy your strength shall again be boosted with the aura of Ruggilli.  By summoning this enemies of Ruggilli will quickly perish. Keep in mind though, both your strengths and weaknesses and you will surely thrive.

        <li>Updating Crossfire (17, 13)<pre>The development of Crossfire never stops.  Keep your server and client up-to-date so you can always enjoy the latest features and bugfixes.  For a detailed list of valid download sites, look at: http://crossfire.real-time.com/download/
</pre></li>
        <li>Manual part III (17, 11)<pre>You can do several things by using only the mouse.  In the inventory-window, you can examine, apply and drop things by clicking the different mouse-buttons.  In the look-window you can do mostly the same, except you pick up items instead of dropping them when you click the right mouse button.  In both windows you can move the scrollbar in different ways by clicking the different mouse-button on it (but only if there are more items than can be displayed in the window).  In the graphical window, you can click at places with the left button to find out what is there, or with the right button to move in that general direction.
</pre></li>
        <li>Manual part II (17, 10)<pre>When you have rolled your stats and chosen a profession, you can type `?' at any time to get information about the different keys.  The apply command (bound to key `a') is used for several things, like wearing, removing, wielding, unwielding, drinking, eating, etc.  If you hold down Shift while pressing `A', you will apply the object below you.  This is the only way to enter a house.  In addition to the direct commands which are bound to different keys, you can also type more complex commands by pressing the '-key first.  To get more information about these, try typing "'help".
</pre></li>
        <li>Manual part I (17, 9)<pre>Crossfire is a multiplayer graphical arcade and adventure game made for the X-Window environment.  It has certain flavours from other games, especially Gauntlet (TM) and Nethack/Moria.  Any number of players can move around in their own window, picking up / using items and battle monsters.  The players all do battle in the same world, and can communicate with each other (even fight with each other).  The goal of the game is to survive and to have FUN.
</pre></li>
        <li>History of Crossfire (17, 8)<pre>Frank Tore Johansen started writing Crossfire in March, 1992.  Since then, many people throughout the world have contributed source code, maps, graphics, and other forms of support.  Early versions of Crossfire looked much like early renditions of the game Gauntlet.  Since then, features like that of Nethack and Moria were adopted.  Presently development is moving in the direction of producing a more complex game similar to Ultima.  Throughout the years though, Crossfire continues to maintain it's very own distinctive style.

After the fee has been paid, two characters must stand on the pedestals in the small southern rooms, while the third picks up the keys from the rooms above the altars.
If there are no keys available, we're very sorry, but it means we've run out of available guild houses.  Perhaps you should look into joining an existing guild instead.

Since the destruction of our fair city by the lake I have come here -- to do the best that I can with what is left.  Humans, goblins and gnolls - we have put aside old hatred to build this last outpost community.  Many of us humans are favored as food by the cyclops, too many of us have lost our lives to the cooking pot.  I am the last human, and if I leave no children from my loins, then I consider the goblins and gnolls whom I have taught human skills my legacy.  Let those foolish immortals judge lesser men! I am a man now without religion.  Shame on those who worship such fickle beings! And a pardon on the three who have dared defy them!

</pre></li>
        <li>sign (15, 9)<pre>There are many different types of doors.
The most basic type is a simple closed door.  You can open this kind of door with a generic key like the one beside this sign.
If you have no keys you can try to break the door down by attacking it.
If you have the lockpicking skill you can try to open the door by typing 'ready_skill lockpicking' and then 'firing' (usually pressing shift + <direction>) towards the door like you would fire an arrow or a bolt.
There are also locked doors which can only be opened with special keys...
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (15, 4)<pre>Keys can also be used to open locked chests, but not all chests are locked. Beware, though, as some doors and chests are trapped. Use caution.
The chest is locked by chance, but the key to open it is right there.

        <li>Food (11, 24)<pre>Remember, you need to eat or you'll starve. Never forget to carry food with you. If you have food and your food level reaches zero, your character will randomly eat some of it.
Would you like some more food now? If so, go near the altar and say 'food'.
</pre></li>
        <li>Books (11, 18)<pre>You will find a lot of books in the Crossfire world.
Some are so difficult your character may not understand them.
Not everyone finds all books interesting, but one important fact is: Reading them often yields experience.
Simply apply a book to read it.
Reading is important:
- learning high-level spells requires a high literacy level, gained by reading a lot
- texts contain various information about the world, including places that may be interesting to visit, monsters, and so on
- texts may give hints about quests
- crafting (alchemy, for instance) recipes are usually found in books, so you can learn how to make many items
</pre></li>
        <li>Using Items (11, 12)<pre>-------------------
Tutorial: Using items
To use items in Crossfire, there are two basic methods.
The first is to use mouse buttons on your inventory.
The second is to use the command
-----
apply
-----
which uses the top object on the ground where you are standing.
Of course it isn't easy to type the command each time you want to use a lever or eat some food.  I recommend you bind the command to a key.
If you don't know how to do bind commands to keys, follow the binding tutorial by talking to Manu, the crazy key binder.  He is to your left.

</pre></li>
        <li>Ranged Weapons (10, 16)<pre>If you have a ranged weapon this would be a good chance to practice firing it at the ants.
First you ready the weapon, then hold down the fire key and press a direction key to fire a missile.
Fire is usually bound to the <shift> key by now you must know what direction keys are to have gotten as far as this sign.
Make sure to keep enough ammo on hand!
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (9, 5)<pre>Welcome to Crossfire!
If you are new to this game, this map was made for you! Here you will find information on how to play.
Want a quick start? Speak to Sigmund at the entrance. Don't remember how to speak? Just type:
-------
say hello
-------
in the command box of your client or use the chat boxes (if there are any).
You will find many signs like this one in the game.
Never forget to read them as they give you useful information.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (7, 18)<pre>-------------------
Tutorial: Traps
Searching for traps can save your life in Crossfire.
Some traps are difficult to find, others are easy.
Some traps are dangerous, others are harmless.
To find a trap, use your trap finding skills by typing
------
use_skill find traps
------
but it is a lot easier to use the default "s" keybinding to find traps.
Some traps are hard to find, so you might want to search a number of times.
If you find a trap, disarm them so you can continue your way fully secure.
To disarm a trap, use the command
------
use_skill disarm traps
------
If at first you do not succeed, try, try again.
The "d" key is bound to the disarm command by default.
It is really useful to use keybindings for these actions since they are used a lot.
Now follow the black marbled path and try to find and disarm all the traps.
Are you confused yet?

        <li>Food (2, 13)<pre>Food is important for you to stay alive. Apply it to eat it. If your food bar runs down, you will begin to rapidly lose HP. Regenerating HP and mana also requires food, so remember to bring plenty to battles!

        <li>Cures for Miscellaneous Problems (12, 27)<pre>Poison may be cured via the "cure poison" prayer.  Madness or confusion may be cured via the "cure confusion" prayer.  Blindness may be cured via the "cure blindness" prayer.  The "restoration" spell cures all hazards mentioned above.  Note that these spells are also available on scrolls.
</pre></li>
        <li>How to Restore Drained Abilities (12, 26)<pre>Drained abilities (stats), lost by fighting undead, or dying, may be restored via drinking a "potion of life."  The ones who are experienced in the skill of priesthood, they can pray over an altar and eventually get restored by their deity.  However, this does not work for all cults.

        <li>On the Healing of Wounds (10, 27)<pre>Many spells are effective for speeding the recovery of a wounded person.  Some potions are also efficacious.  In increasing order of effectiveness:
minor healing
medium healing
major healing
heal
restoration
The healing potion is equivalent to the heal spell. The Restoration spell does NOT restore depleted stats.
</pre></li>
        <li>On the Cure of Disease (10, 26)<pre>You find a lengthy treatise on disease and its cure.  Some diseases, apparently, are more difficult to cure than others, and require a higher level of skill.  Other diseases can be expected to run their course and go away without causing serious harm, unless of course, one is in a situation in which temporary incapacity is fatal.  The cure disease spell is effective against disease, except as remarked above.  Restoration also works well against disease.  Cure wounds spells won't cure disease, but they will reduce symptoms.  Cure wounds spells therefore can be used to keep a person alive until the disease may be cured.  Also, they may keep him alive until the disease naturally goes away.  There are also claims of herbal, alchemical, animal, or other magical cures for disease, but these belong in another treatise.

        <li>Notes on Ruggilli (3, 10)<pre>To Whom it may concern,
Ruggilli is the true God of destruction.  His power is the strength behind the mighty red dragons.  You too can share this power, but at a cost.  If you proceed with Ruggilli you will liken yourself to Him.  Ruggilli has an immense appetite, you will find yourself eating more than is normal, carry a little extra food and you need not worry, but woe if you run out.  As a follower of Ruggilli, his protections and vulnerabilities are also shared.  You will become more resistant to fire but less to cold, also your very skin will protect you from any physical projectile.  This will compensate for your inability to wear armour as Ruggilli deems such items lowly.  Ruggilli is a god of chaos, you must use this to your advantage.  A quick attack is your main strength as Ruggilli will immolate all your enemies.  Be warned though, creatures immune to fire shall not be harmed by Ruggilli's will.  If you prove yourself worthy your strength shall again be boosted with the aura of Ruggilli.  By summoning this enemies of Ruggilli will quickly perish.  Keep in mind though, both your strengths and weaknesses and you will surely thrive.

Ready for your first fight?  On the other side of this door are some ants.  They're mostly harmless, so run into them as fast as you can, until you kill them.  Be sure to kill the anthill too, so it can't produce more ants.  Remember to run hold <CTRL> then press and hold direction key.  Many monsters have "generators" like this which produce more monsters every so often.
After you kill the ants, go through the next door.

Stop and take a look at your inventory for a moment.  If you started the game with any armor or a hand-to-hand weapon like a sword, you probably should ready them now. (In most clients you do this by middle-clicking the item in your inventory, or also try holding the <SHIFT> key and then right-click mouse.)  Don't make the mistake of many new players, and run into your first monsters naked and empty-handed. :-)
You can also try the long-form of the commands like:  'apply sword   OR   'apply chainmail
Using the  'apply  command multiple times on the same item will toggle between "readied" and "unreadied".

Do this with the command ('use_skill find traps), which is often bound to the 's' key for Search.  If you find a trap, you can try to disarm it with ('use_skill disarm traps).  Usually the "d" key for Disarm.  You can only find and disable traps if you have those skills.
Some doors will open when you walk up to them, then close after a moment. Be careful not to get crushed by standing in the doorway too long!
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (20, 9)<pre>=== Earthwalls ===
Some walls, called "earthwalls," are soft and can be battered down and destroyed.  Run at the wall to your east until you pass through.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (20, 5)<pre>=== Information ===
There are many sources of information other than signs like this one.  Did you see the sign on the wall as you were running here? Sometimes information comes from non-visible sources like that, so always keep your eyes open and don't miss anything that shows up in your Messages area.
Information also comes from books, notes, and many other sources.  The smallest note can be the first clue to a large treasure or heroic quest, so always gather as much information as possible. Some notes and books you will be able to pick up and take with you, while others will be fixed where they are, but they all may be important to read.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (20, 3)<pre>A sign on the wall says:
Here is a note you can pick up and take with you. (You may have already picked it up automatically if your client is set to do that. If so, find it in your inventory panel and read it by middle-clicking or whatever action your client uses to apply inventory items.) You may wish to read it first (press the 'a' key), and then pick it up (press the <COMMA> key or type 'take).  Now it will be in your inventory, so you can read it anytime you need to.
</pre></li>
        <li>note (20, 3)<pre>The exit password is "orc-knuckle"!  (TAKE this note with you.  Use the comma key to pick it up.  You'll need it much later, after you meet Harold.)
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (19, 9)<pre>Cool, huh!  Buttons and other switches can be used to do all sorts of things, sometimes on completely different areas of a map, so if you ever think you're stuck, look around for any of these kinds of triggers that might open a way out for you.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (19, 7)<pre>Sometimes large buttons in the floor can be activated by a large weight. Run into this boulder to push it onto the button to your west, and see what happens.
Boulders and other "rollable" items like barrels can only be pushed, never pulled, so be careful not to push them into corners from where you won't be able to move them to their destination.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (19, 1)<pre>=== Doors ===
There are many kinds of doors in Crossfire. Some doors will open for you, so you can walk right through. Ordinary locked doors can be bashed open by attacking them or using lockpicks. Stronger locked doors may require a certain key, or open when you speak a magic word or activate a certain trigger somewhere.
To get through this first door, run into it until you break through.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (18, 3)<pre>=== Talking to People ===
You can also get information from non-player characters (NPCs) in the game by talking to them. To talk to the man at the end of this hallway when you're finished reading this, walk up next to him and type: 'say hello
The 'say command will let you talk to nearby NPCs and other Crossfire players who are on the same map as you, so it is your main way to communicate inside the game. The <DOUBLE-QUOTE> key (") is often a binding for the command:  'say
Many NPC have useful information, but they will only tell you about it if you ask about the right things. Saying "hello" is a good start. If the NPC replies, look for words in his reply that might be important, and ask about them. For example, if he says, "Hello, do you have any food?" ask him about food ('say food), and he may say something else in response to that. Saying words like quest, key, treasure, and other things you're interested in may start up very interesting conversations!
Be careful not to run into friendly NPCs; dead men tell no tales.
Now go talk to that old man.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (17, 11)<pre>Would you like to take on something stronger? If so, there are a few kobolds on the other side of this door to your east that shouldn't give you too much trouble. If the ants were enough of a challenge, skip the kobolds and go north.
</pre></li>
        <li>Rune of Marking (17, 9)<pre>Marking runes like this one are created with magic spells, but they contain messages just like signs do. Marking runes are harmless, but other runes can be very dangerous, so step carefully!
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (17, 1)<pre>A message scrawled on the wall says:
Waybreads are the MRE (Meals-Ready-to-Eat)
of Crossfire.  They weigh very little but pack
a large food value.  They are much more
expensive than normal food, but when you
can afford them, they are the best food to
take on long trips or dungeon excursions,
since their light weight won't slow you down.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (16, 1)<pre>A message scrawled on the wall says:
When you kill monsters, sometimes they leave body parts behind, and these can be taken and eaten also.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (15, 14)<pre>Did you get the key under the anthill?  If not, go back and get it. You will need it to get through this door. Keep in mind that keys are often hidden under other objects like that.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (15, 12)<pre>How did you do?  Watch your hit points (HP) / Health  closely during battle. If they get too low, you can always retreat and come back. Hit points gradually regenerate over time, so if you took damage, wait until your HP is back to the maximum before moving on. Eating food speeds up HP regeneration, so you may want to eat this food now.
</pre></li>
        <li>Rune of Marking (15, 9)<pre>See that rune to the north?  You may have to wait a few seconds to see it. Don't step on it; it might hurt you!  If you have the find traps and disarm traps skills mentioned earlier, you can step NEXT to it and attempt to find and disarm it. Since it's at the end of the hallway, you might decide it's not worth the risk, since there's nothing beyond it, but it's good to increase your experience in those skills whenever possible.
Remember: to search for traps, press 's' (or type 'use_skill find traps), and to attempt to disarm any traps you find, press 'd' (or type 'use_skill disarm traps).
Sometimes you may need to press 's' or 'd' many times (10-30 times!) before your character finally finds the traps and then disarms it.  If your Messages window (here) doesn't say you spotted the trap, or disarmed it (or set it off accidentally) then keep trying 's' and 'd' a bit more.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (15, 5)<pre>A sign on the wall says:  Slow Down!!
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (15, 1)<pre>A message scrawled on the wall says:
There are many types of food you can eat. Be careful, though: food that you find may be poisonous, so to be safe, don't eat food until you've identified it. (More on identifying items later.)  Most things you buy at a shop are already fully identified for you in advance.
</pre></li>
        <li>magic_mouth (14, 1)<pre>A message scrawled on the wall says:
This is a standard food.  You can apply it while it's on the ground, the same way you apply signs and other objects, or you can pick it up and take it with you.
</pre></li>
        <li>Rune of Marking (13, 9)<pre>There is a rune at the end of this hallway too, but you might not be able to see it. You can try to find and disarm it, though.
</pre></li>
        <li>Rune of Marking (11, 9)<pre>Chests and other containers are often protected by traps. To find and disarm these traps, stand on the chest or next to it while using the find traps and disarm traps commands.
Once you think a chest is safe, open it by applying it with the 'a' key, and see what's inside.
Sometimes you won't be able to find a trap, or it will be triggered when you try to disarm it. That's just the risk you take in the pursuit of treasure! If you get hurt by a trap, let yourself heal before you move on, in case you walk into another one.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (11, 5)<pre>=== Movement ===
You can move in any of eight directions: north, south, east, west, and the four diagonals in between. Pressing a movement key once (or executing a movement command) will move you one tile in that direction. If something is in the way, for example a monster, then you would normally attack it.  By default you will avoid attacking friendly game characters.
To run in a direction, which is very useful when fighting, battering down doors, or traveling long distances, hold down the <CTRL> key and press and hold the key for direction you wish to run.
To see a reminder of movement commands / directions, type:  'help move
Now run to the end of this hallway, and read the sign there.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (11, 3)<pre>=== Commands ===
There are many commands you can use to do everything from movement to attacking to casting spells to identifying treasure. Any command in Crossfire can be executed by typing ' (a single quote) followed by the command.
So to move southeast, for example, you could type 'southeast. To read this sign, you could type 'apply sign. These "long-form" commands are always available for everything you can do in the game.
However, it would be cumbersome to type commands like that for common actions, so many commands are bound to keys by default.  "Bound" or "binding keys" means assigning a single key as a substitution for typing the entire command.  This varies from client to client, but you will probably find that the movement commands are bound to the arrow keys on your keypad, for example.  In the example above, the key 'a' has a binding to the command for  'apply
There are many other default keybindings, and you can create your own for any action or series of actions that you use regularly. See the documentation for your Crossfire client for more information on keybindings.

        <li>magic_mouth (11, 1)<pre>Welcome to Crossfire!

You are now in the beginner's area, which will teach you the fundamentals of playing Crossfire, and prepare you to survive in this vast and sometimes dangerous world.
As you pass through these halls, read all the signs and any other information provided, and you'll soon learn the basics of the game.

        <li>Rune of Marking (9, 9)<pre>Not all runes are harmful. The rune to your north will restore your health!
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (7, 13)<pre>Ready your bow or crossbow by clicking on it. Arrows or bolts in your inventory will be used automatically.
To fire a missile weapon, hold down your Fire <SHIFT> key, and press the movement key in the direction you want to fire.
On the other side of these doors are some monsters.  Pull the lever to open the doors, and shoot them all! Don't worry, there's a force preventing them from reaching you. Continue down the passageway until you get back to this hallway, then go north.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (7, 9)<pre>If you have a bow or crossbow in your inventory, go south for missile weapons training.  If you do not, go north.
</pre></li>
        <li>Rune of Marking (7, 5)<pre>=== Altars ===
Altars have many different uses.  Some altars are consecrated to a particular god.  Do not pray over these altars unless you wish to worship that god!  (More on gods later.)  Altars can also cast spells and perform other actions if you place the correct sacrifice on them.
The altar to your east is an "altar of detect magic."  Dropping money on it will cause it to cast detect magic on all the items in your inventory.  To drop money, right-click on it in your inventory while standing on the altar.  (Make sure you pick up your change.)
Magic items are often worth more than identical non-magic items, so detect magic can help you decide which ones to sell and which ones to identify or keep.
</pre></li>
        <li>Rune of Marking (7, 3)<pre>This altar to your east is a "detect curse" altar.  It works the same as the "detect magic" altar below.  Altars like these are often found in shops in towns.
Always detect curse on items you find before applying them.  If you apply a cursed item, you won't be able to remove it until the curse is removed.
</pre></li>
        <li>Rune of Marking (7, 1)<pre>Tables work much like altars.  The table to the
east is an "identify item" table.  It will identify the unidentified items in your inventory, one at a time, for 20 gold pieces each.  Tables are often found in shops too, especially magic shops.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (5, 9)<pre>Magic scrolls like the one to your south contain one spell each.  When you read a magic scroll, the spell is cast and the scroll crumbles into dust.  Take this scroll and save it for some time when you have collected a bunch of items and want to cast detect magic on them.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (5, 7)<pre>Some monsters, like mice, can multiply without a generator.  If not killed quickly, these monsters can spread to fill up a map completely.  Run through this door and kill the mice inside before they get out of control.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (5, 3)<pre>In areas other than shops, teleporters can transport you instantly from place to place.  Beware: a teleporter might send you into a dangerous area!  This teleporter, however, will take you right across the fence to the south.
</pre></li>
        <li>sign (5, 1)<pre>Shops are an important part of Crossfire.  Shops will sell you all sorts of adventuring supplies and they buy almost any treasure you bring back to sell.
To enter a shop, step on the shop mat (with a "$").  This will transport you to the inside.  To exit, simply step on the inside mat.  To sell items, drop them on the shop floor.  To buy items, simply pick up what you want and leave.  The cost of the items will be taken from your inventory.  If you don't have enough money to pay your bill, you won't be allowed to leave, and you will have to drop enough of the items you picked up until you can afford what you're holding.
You may enter this shop and look around, and buy something if you have the money.  When you're in the shop, clicking on an item in your inventory will tell you how much the shop will pay you for it.  Standing over an item on the shop floor and examining it (press the 'e' key or type:  'examine) will tell you that item's price.
WARNING: Be very careful not to drop anything you aren't sure you want to sell!  Once dropped, an item is sold and belongs to the shop, and the price for buying it back may be many times what you sold it for.  Check your client's documentation (maybe a HELP button?) for instructions on how to lock your important inventory items so you can't accidentally drop them.

        <li>sign (3, 9)<pre>Potions can help you in many ways, boosting your stats temporarily or permanently, giving you resistance to certain attacks or healing you.  Save this potion of healing for some time when you are injured and unable to retreat to heal slowly.
Keep in mind that potions you find can be cursed just like other objects, so always get them identified before using them.

</pre></li>
        <li>sign (1, 12)<pre>A Bed To Reality is used as a natural exit from the game.  When your character restarts the game again, they will start at the same place they (press the 'a' key) applied the last Bed To Reality.  It's also a way for you to (re)set your character's "home base", if you prefer to start/save in a particular town, like the one at the end of this hallway.
The next time you login, your player will start from that bed's location, with all the inventory items you had when you saved.  Also, if your player ever dies, you will be returned to the location of the last bed of reality you used.
You may use this one now, and then continue on after logging back in.  Your NEXT mission will be to exit this map and find the Wanderer's Inn located in the city of Scorn.  This is where you want to use a Bed To Reality to make sure it's your next starting place for your character.

Through drink he deluded them, through tricks beguiled them, and thus enslaved them to his master; the master of all who practice that which does not come from above... thus they came here to Navar and raised his tower to the heavens.

        <li>The Imperial Tribune: EXTRA EDITION (4, 36)<pre>HEADLINE: EXPLOSION ROCKS TAVERN
A bomber detonated a high powered explosive device in the popular Goth's Tavern in Scorn.  The blast killed two and injured 5.  The bomber is reported to have screamed "Die booze ridden devil worshipers! Viva Valriel!" before throwing the bomb and then fleeing on foot.  He is believed to have be a popular priest at the 'Traveling Ministry Of The Most Holy Power.'
CRIME ON THE RISE:
The Ministry of Peace has released a report saying that crime in Scorn is skyrocketing.  The Ministry blames "piracy."  The Guild of Showmen supports the study.
CHURCH OF VALRIEL TIES TO VIOLENCE:
An undercover investigation into the 'Holy Church of Valriel' has discovered monetary ties to a militant group operating under the 'Traveling Ministry Of The Most Holy Power.'  When asked about this situation the High Priest of Valriel said, "Ask God."
THREE KILLED IN POISON GAS ATTACK:
Three women were killed when trying to enter a tavern near the western wall of Navar.  Before they could give the password for entry into the tavern a figure unleashed a nerve agent into the air killing the women.  It is believed this was an attack by a right wing religious organization who worship Valriel.
CHILD STABS SELF - KNIVES BANNED
A child killed himself by stabbing himself.  All knives over one foot are now banned by order of the high court of Navar, swords are unaffected.
SCORN NOW LARGEST WESTERN CITY
The census of last year has now confirmed that Scorn is now the largest western city by population.  Taxes are expected to rise, Navar unaffected.
WAR IMMINENT?
Talk of war against the dragons is circulating around Scorn.  Since the Dragon Emissary started demanding tribute tensions have worsened.  The question now seems to be how big an army must be raised?

We have arrived at the swamps of Arranore to study the local simian population.  Legends speak of a time when Arranore was actually a thriving city state but in modern memory this swamp has always been home only to the gnats and the apes.
Niome, my lovely wife is eager to look for relics or ruins to prove or disprove the existence of ancient Arranore, but for me it will be enough to study the gentle Arranorian apes.
