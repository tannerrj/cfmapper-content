<p><b>Region's longname:</b> The Old City of Scorn</p>
<p><b>Region description:</b> You find yourself gasping in wonder at the extensive caverns underneath the city, here there remains the ruins of old Scorn. A reminder of the great power the city once possessed, and a sign of how far it has fallen. As you look around however you notice that whilst the previous inhabitants of these ruins are no longer present, some new ones seem to have taken their place, and these denizens don't appear to be very welcoming.
